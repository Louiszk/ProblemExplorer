I'm a 35 yo male, and I usually ask women to a coffee first date as a way to get things moving sooner rather than texting into perpetuity. It seems like even if things are tracking okay/well on the apps, at the coffee date ask they will go MIA (or in one case, tell me that they don't do coffee, it's drinks at minimum). These women are at least 28 but more often are north of 30, and I have honest intentions (e.g. actually getting to know them) which I would think coffee indicates.

Quite frustrating when you've just pulled a shot in the morning, and now need to wait for the steam boiler. The technician (authorised Rancilio tech, not that it means much) could not replicate the problem, but had watched a video I filmed when the issue occurred to help with troubleshooting.  Their suspicion is that the water level meter is not detecting water in the steam boiler due to the water being too pure , causing it to overflow -- this apparently as a result of recent rainfall. No real parts needed changing apparently, and they are claiming other customers -- particularly owners of Rocket machines -- have experienced similar issues. I've read a little on water level meters, unsure how the Rancilio part relates or functions in comparison, and it does seem some equipment has a potentiometer to adjust the sensitivity if water purity effects conductivity and water level readings. Unsure how or if this relates to my issue -- or if i'm just being taken for a ride.  Anyone else with a machine notice issues at all?  Should I start doing nasty things to my tap water before using it?  Do I gargle my tap water before filling the machine?  Wee in it?

I've done my research, asked around, but never gotten a real answer. Since living a few years in Melbourne I've tried \"the best coffee\" in many of Europe's largest cities, several of them even had \"imported\" baristas from Australia. But, still, it's not even close. It's good, but it's just another coffee. Far from the taste/feeling the average cup in Melbourne/Australia gave me. I have heard countless reasons on why this is, but nothing makes sense.   Europe have some of the best and freshest mountain water around.   The machines should be of equal quality to the ones in Australia.   The baristas should be comparable.   Europe should have access to the same beans.   Europe's coffee culture is old, important and serious.   Something I'm missing? Any ideas? Or, is this just one of our world's great mysteries that will never be solved? All opinions appreciated!

Whole beans, crushed beans, DATE SEEDS. And then I find a solution to my problems- Starbucks frappuchinos. The hot ones knock me out instantly but the frappuchinos keep me awake for 20+ hours.

I do however have ADHD friends and I know the symptoms lol I have iron deficiency and Vitamin D issues, been on pills for three weeks now. Too short to see an effect but they did contribute to my sleepiness and I know they contribute something in this. I will ask the baristas to use the frap coffee for a normal drink, I didnt know they were different coffees. I can say this isn't a sugar rush really, I stay up 20 hours easy after one frap.

Let me start off by saying that I am not a coffee drinker, I never liked it however my wife loves it especially her lattes. So in a few weeks our 9 yr anniversary is coming up and I really want to surprise my wife with a brand new latte maker. Lately her current one is giving her problems and she has been mentioning needing a new one. The one we had was around $100 or so but Since our anniversary is coming up and thinking how my wife always is semi ok with my big purchases like tvs, soundbars, and tech stuff I wanted to buy her a really really nice coffee maker, something that she will love that I guess can do it all. I'm thinking for the budget I can go up to $1000 for something that will last and can do and can make the following: Somewhat space saver for the counter( I know this might not be possible) Not that noisy Easy cleaning/self cleaning especially for the froth ( I read a lot of horror stories about lack of ability to clean this part) Lattes Cappuccino Iced coffee Coffee Grinds coffee Ground coffee powder Kcups/ and non kcups Espresso Has a frother Has parts that is dish washer safe Can be single serve or multiserve ( remember I don't drink coffee) I'm not sure if there is other types of coffee types, specs and or features that I should include or need but if I am missing it,  I want it. The thinking is this will be an investment in something long term but more so I'm hopeful that my wife will enjoy this maker and will want to try to make different types of coffee that she has not made before. I seen some like Philips 4300 and 5400 as well as De'longhi ECAM29084SB and what I believe is the same exact version but this one is on QVC for $200 less then what best buy is charging De'longhi ECAM29084SBx but I'm not sure if these are worth the price, or if they last long and are good to invest in If any of you fine coffee drinkers can chime on in with some recommendations that will be awesome and truly appreciated    "], ["Make dumb coffee machine Smart!

For example, a person that has the title of Jungle would be able to harvest resources such as tropical trees and cacao and no other person would be able to do that. I want these titles to be centered around something specific, so that the players without a title still would be able to enjoy the game without feeling restricted. I want to create those titles with a purpose of promoting trading within server. Can someone please give me ideas for such titles? Mods are allowed (1.20.4 ver). For example I want to add a coffee mod and only the person with a Jungle title would be able to harness it. I don't need mods for automated title system, the title and following the rules of it would be trust based.

I returned it and just received the new v2.1 with the white power button. I asked the manufacturer (MiiCoffee) if its a functionality or aesthetic change, and they said its aesthetic only. Now I have my concerns about it. Is anyone else having problems with the power button, specifically the white one?    "]]
