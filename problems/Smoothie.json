She has no other family or friends to watch him and cannot afford traditional tutoring or daycare, so I'm  all she has. She drops him off at my place in the morning. On the days he's over I can't really leave home since he's a handful in public. I'm having issues keeping him fed. What she packs for him isn't exactly substantial. On most days she'll send him over with a pack of cheap instant noodles, a fruit cup or smoothie, and a few cookies. This is supposed to last him all day. He's a normal weight for his age and height but has a big appetite and can be a picky eater. I've brought this to his mother's attention twice already. He's also very used to the junk his mom buys or orders for him. My husband and I don't have kids and I'm a light eater, so it's not like we have a stash of kid-friendly frozen foods just lying around for him. I've had to cook for him a few times, but whether he'll eat what I make is another story. He won't eat any potato that isn't a french fry, most fruit, any other vegetables, soup, or meat that isn't a fried chicken nugget. Whenever I tell his mom that her son needs more food, she just throws in another second pack of instant ramen or some other nutritionally void junk that makes his ADHD worse. He's also a little sneaky. I once gave him a few chocolate chips as an incentive for doing his homework and now he snoops around the kitchen looking for them nearly every day. He also tries to make excuses to go into the bedroom (which he isn't allowed in because of his habit of taking things that aren't his) to look for snacks. Not food. Snacks. I know this is pretty normal kid behavior, but it's getting on my nerves. I tried to stock up for him before, but he goes through food so fast it's not feasible with what I'm being paid to care for him. A pack of nuggets he'll finish in 2 days is half of what she pays me, and that's just one item. My own family tells me to feed him only what his mother packs and nothing else until his mom, but I can't let him suffer because of his mom's failings. Do you guys have any advice on what I can say or do to solve this issue? Note: His mom doesn't cook, so meal prep on her days off is out of the question. I've been to their place. The shelves are only stocked with what she likes to eat, adult health supplements, and instant noodles. Like I said before, they only eat out most of the time.

So we're both around sophomore age so we have limited access to anything She had a really bad experience with and ed in 7th grade and had to go to the hospital a few times. Over winter break her mental health got really bad and she started starving herself again. She used to follow the pro Ana goddess thing when she was younger and I worry she subconsciously did it. She ate for a few days when school was back but now whenever she smells food or eats it she throws up. She's been terribly sick like her whole body hurting, feeling like passing out. She says this has happened before and it just leads to the Ed but she has no idea how to stop it. She has a therapist but an very abusive mother that cannot know the details. She struggled even opening up to me about it. She takes Zoloft and has an anxiety medicine but I'm not sure how much it'll help I just need to find out how to make her eat. I doordashed her a smoothie the other day. But I can't keep doing that. How do I make her eat?she can't go back to how she was    "], ["Help for a starving Anole?", "3", "5", "2023-09-10T23:27:19.700000+0000", "https://www.reddit.com/r/Lizards/comments/16ffc1k/help_for_a_starving_anole/", "Hey friends! I care primarily for tarantulas so please go easy on me here - My friend owns a plant shop and on one of her imports a little Cuban knight anole tagged along. She didn't find him in the shop until a few days after the shipment came in and she contacted me looking for some help. I have extra ten gallon tanks, heat lights, crickets etc because of my T's so I took him off her hands. He's still quite small (maybe 5 inches?) but he's VERY skinny. He won't eat crickets, so I blended some fruit (mango and berries) into a smoothie texture for him and he took some from a syringe. He's also drinking water. Currently have him in humidity and under a heat lamp - what else can I do to get his weight and protein intake up? Any help is appreciated :)    "], ["Help with smoothie", "7", "1", "2024-04-04T15:41:14.073000+0000", "https://www.reddit.com/r/sugarfree/comments/1bvqeng/help_with_smoothie/", "Hey guys, I have been trying to cut out sugar because I'm pre diabetic and I am also hoping it will help with acne and period cramps.

The good news is that before that happened, I carefully watched them make it and noted all of the ingredients. The bad news is that, despite numerous efforts, I can't seem to recreate it at home. I'm currently using steel cut oatmeal (which I cook earlier & cool in the fridge), almond milk, frozen strawberries, fresh banana, peanut butter, and cinnamon. I don't add any ice. I've played with the proportions, but it never tastes as good as I remember.  I think they used Soy milk instead of Almond, can't remember if they added a tiny bit of ice, and know they added a little powdered protein, but don't know how much any of those really impact the taste. Does anyone have any advice? Edit: Ideally, I'd really appreciate amounts or at least proportions if possible.

I am absolutely horrible about flavors/textures, as such I know its truly a long shot to find something that works well for me but the only way ill know is if I ask and try. Fruit I will eat:   Apples   seriously that's all   Vegetables:   Bell peppers   Onions   Broccoli   Cauliflower   Peas   Corn   Potatoes   Cucumbers   Tomatos (i like them well enough for salad/pizza but ive never been a fan of V8 etc)   When it comes to artificial flavors I like fake cherry as jolly rancher/starburst, same for orange and lemon. I like strawberry poptarts but i know that is a super fake flavor as I hate strawberry flavors in many other things. I know what I'm asking is a tall order but if someone knows any solid recipes I can use to make basically a meal replacement with some chocolate/peanut butter (protein) powder that would be healthier i would greatly appreciate it.
