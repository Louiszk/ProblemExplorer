Well next year we have a Kung Fu Panda 4. The Arc was perfectly finished in a trilogy - but they have just to milk it. Same with Dragonball - same with Star Wars/Palpatine. Same with the Simpsons that got medicore like 10 Seasons Ago. Or Family Guy or South Park. Nowadays nothing is allowed to remaind completed - to be just done with. If it was popular - if it made money - it will be going on forerver. Or it will be ressurected because of Nostalgia. This makes self enclosed stories impossible. Because there always has to be a continuation 10 or 20 years later that will destroy the original by adding new stuff that contradicts the original. Or they make a remake or reebot like Velma that takes a dump on the original. Or they just keep going past their primes until the show just becomes unrecognizable. You just cant continue something forever or reebot it after it has been finished. In the process it will lose its flavour, it will lose the things that made it good and special in the first place. But modern media just doesnt care. As long as it makes money - keep it going. Ressurect it after decades. As long as it makes money - who cares? There will always be some fans that will swallow everything - no matter how bad it is - as long as they get more... Note: Its something different if Shows like Samurai Jack or Final Space or Invader Zim get revived/continued because these were canceled before the main plannes story could finish.

I had my first child several years ago and during the pregnancy my breasts grew a little but not much. I had an unforeseen c-section and both my baby and I were safe and healthy. The last day at the hospital (day 3) my milk came in. All the nurses and pediatrician saw my breasts and told me milk has come in and that I had to keep trying breastfeeding and massaging for the milk to flow. I was discharged that day. Here is where I went through the most stressful part of my life. I tried to exclusively breastfeed but my baby wasn't getting enough milk and was losing weight too fast. After several days the pediatrician strongly recommended she get formula and we gave in (at the end of the day no regrets bc the most important thing is that she's fed and healthy). I decided to exclusively pump at that point and talked to other friends for tips, saw 2 different lactation consultants (they checked my posture when breastfeeding and also confirmed I was using the correct flange size and using the machine correctly /Spectra). For the next 4 months I ate sooo much oatmeal, tried sunflower lecithin, drank lots of water, and pumped 7-8 times every single day! All for producing maybe at most 2-3 oz total. This was total milk produced in a single day!?! From both breasts. I still can't believe I put up with so much for 4 months for so little. When I asked my obgyn later he said he didn't have an answer and that our bodies are all different. This has been my biggest mystery and I want to be successful this time around with my second baby. Did anyone else experience this and do you have any tips? *During these 4 months my breasts still got hard with milk, had to wear bra pads due to leaking, and at times needed warm massages due to blockage (never mastitis though).

My baby boy has always had a big appetite from the start\u00e2\u0080\u00a6but my milk supply has increased really slowly. Basically, I think I had colostrum for 2 weeks PP\u00e2\u0080\u00a6so he was not getting satiated at the breast. The reason I know that is because he'll keep crying and put his hands in his mouth and won't settle (even though I tried putting him at the breast as much as I could) We are working towards EBF - hopefully. Now at 6 weeks PP, I have at least SOME milk supply to be confident enough to slowly wean off formula. He already eats less formula now and I finally had some meals where he seemed satisfied from BF. But, the majority of meals, he still isn't satisfied. What would happen\u00e2\u0080\u00a6He'll suckle and suckle (depends how much stash I have) and then get frustrated and start crying, then screaming, then refuse to take the breast because milk won't come out anymore\u00e2\u0080\u00a6I don't have this problem always - when milk comes out fine form the breast, he likes to BF. I'm beginning to suspect a problem with my letdown\u00e2\u0080\u00a6is it possible that there's too much break between letdowns? I also power pumped and  got 50 ml (almost 2 oz with power pumping?) and most of the milk came out the first 10 minutes of power pumping\u00e2\u0080\u00a6then bery little. So, here I am with 40 minutes of pumping and with only first 10 minutes being more productive? Can this also be the case with BF the baby - that most of my milk comes out first minutes, then barely any? Sometimes if he's willing to suckle, another letdown will come later and he'll actively suckle again, but after a while. This night I kept BF him - cluster feeding - up untill one point where he started screaming because there is no more milk and I gave him formula.

So I am getting close to Mammoth Fat, which has 2-5% Lauric and a lot of stearic. and to my surprise, I was not tired after eating (Which I always was after Butter/Cream), felt better and ... lost weight (even though I was at 15% bodyfat with visible abs before). I also felt disgusted with butter/Ghe after only small bites, whereas with suet / bone Marrow, I can eat it spoonwise, no issues. The same happened with eating bone marrow: Good satiation, even hours afterwardsThat made me wonder why? I cannot be the MCTs per se (due to coconut, which i took ratios which would result in similar mct profile as in butter, albeit less C8 and C 10 and more C12), or the Oleic, those are roghly the same. It also is unlikely due to milk protein allergy, as I noticed the same with pure Ghee. The Suet is also refined, --> it cannot be oxidized cholesterol in Ghee. Bone Marrow --> It cannot be the MUFAs. -->It must be the palmitic acid, which is richer in Butter than in Suet, and without oleic and stearic to the rescue. Peter from Hyperlipid (and following him Brad) is quite friendly towards it, because it is good from a protons standpoint. u/FrigoCoder is saying that Palmitic Acid is the endresult of de-novo-lipogenesis and therefore does not result in its own oxidation. https://www.reddit.com/r/ScientificNutrition/comments/10loyke/comment/j5zfm22/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web2x&context=3 Carbs are suppressing CPT1 and therefore Palmitic Acid eaten in Conjunction with Carbs are bad. Which explains why in most nutritional Science Palmitic Acid is bad, but only in a \"High Fat Diet\" (which is also high in Carbs and probably in PUFA). In that Context, Ceramides rise, because you get lipidoxicity (too much unoxidized fat in blood = diabetes). Except I was not eating Carbs, and was ketogenic for 8 years. He also claims that Palmitic Acid is reliant on oleic for its own oxidation. But Butter has oleic also, the ratio is not even as bad as in palm oil. Difference is, Stearic might be converted to oleic (which would raise the ratio), then that stimulates fat oxidation. So it might be the Ratio of Stearic+Oleic/ Palmitic+Myristic (per Nick Norwitz). https://twitter.com/nicknorwitz/status/1323204356557201408  Another aspect is that only Stearic Stimulates Mitochondrial Fission, Palmitic does not. In that sense Stearic seems to be kind of a signalling molecule, a role irreplaceable by palmitic. Oleic also does this: Dose- and Time-Dependent Effects of Oleate on Mitochondrial Fusion/Fission Proteins and Cell Viability in HepG2 Cells: Comparison with Palmitate Effects - PMC (nih.gov)  One thing might be esterification of palmitic Acid in Butter (might be better in Suet?): Matthew Dalby auf X: \u00e2\u0080\u009e@gerdosi @KetoCarnivore Palmitic acid is predominantly esterified in the sn2 position in human milk. But not in cows milk, which is more similar to vegetable oils. Palmitic acid is more in the sn-1 and sn-3 position in cows milk fat. Human milk is rather different to cows milk.\u00e2\u0080\u009c / X (twitter.com)  Question: Am I missing something? I quite like cream + Butter, maybe adding some mufas / stearic is necessary for digestion. I started to make my own yoghurt replacement with suet and whey as main ingredients (casein is also a trigger for allergies and overeating for me). I might also have some form of insulin resistance due to a lot of stress and chronically bad sleep. So maybe dairy fat/ palmitic Acid over 23% is only for the superhealthy?

I tried just filling milk half way and the same happened. Tried filling even less milk and the same happened again \u00e2\u0080\u00a6 Any ideas what the issue is?

I end up finishing my design in like 5 seconds since the milk all rushes out. I can make some nice stacks and tulips, but ripples are impossible because there is way too much milk, meaning the milk isn't a thin stream. Any slower and the design doesn't expand and it sits. So I watched a load of videos and noticed the angle of the pitcher. I only use just enough milk so as not to waste any (200 ml in a 240 ml cup). This means I need to use a very steep angle to get the milk to reach the end of the pitcher, to the point it's almost horizontal. Especially if I'm trying to get close to the surface. When watching experts, the milk gracefully flows out the top with the pitcher almost facing diagonally upwards, allowing a super fine flow. Is there a way I can do latte art without needing excess milk? Or does the problem lie elsewhere?

I'm using a DeLonghi All in one Espresso machine (not the one who bought it, but it's what I have to work with). I've watched countless videos and tutorials, taking note of all the intricate details like shaking the milk beforehand (Califia oat milk), purging the wand right before so no condensation gets in the milk, letting in super small but consistent chirps of air for the first 3-5 seconds or until the jug is as warm as the hand or until the volume is like 1cm higher, etc. Even with all this in mind, I still can't get the milk to reach the right texture. I started to think maybe it's the steam wand. So I replaced it with a 3-hole metal version of the usual rubber piece people online say to use without the big metal shell. Google \u00e2\u0080\u009cdelonghi stilosa steam wand\u00e2\u0080\u009d for a picture of what I'm talking about and you'll also see the metal piece I switched it with. Ok great, should work now. Nope, still not the right texture. Ok, maybe it's the milk (was trying out all the different milk brands my family buys, almond, 2%, oat, sadly no whole milk though). So I got Califia oat milk, the gold standard for oat milk. But, lo and behold, still not reaching the right texture. Ok, let me try one last thing, maybe it's the pressure of the garbage steam wand I have to work with (even though there are videos on YT showing that it's very doable even with just the rubber tip version), maybe it's not creating a big enough whirl pool to distribute the air throughout the milk. So to fix this, after I added enough air and got the milk to the right temperature, which btw I'm checking with a thermometer to make sure it's reaching 140\u00c2\u00b0 F even with the delay, I then continued stirring with a handheld milk frother making sure to not add any more air and only stir until all the bubbles are gone and the texture looks even. I thought I really had it with this one, but still nope. I'm at a loss of what else to try because I'm positive it's something I'm doing wrong but I just can't figure it out. Maybe it's the amount of air I'm letting in? Please let me know if you want to see my steam wand or even how I do the process, because I'll do anything at this point.

I am super new to yogurt making, and I'm having trouble with lumps. Does anyone have any advice, please? From reading previous posts, I think I may be adding too much starter culture or pasteurizing my milk at too high a temperature.                               I've been using the NYT recipe : 2 quarts whole milk 3 to 4 tablespoons plain whole milk yogurt with live and active cultures Step 1 Rub an ice cube over the inside bottom of a heavy pot to prevent scorching (or rinse the inside of the pot with cold water). Add milk and cream, if using, and bring to a bare simmer, until bubbles form around the edges, 180 to 200 degrees. Stir the milk occasionally as it heats. Step 2 Remove pot from heat and let cool until it feels pleasantly warm when you stick your pinkie in the milk for 10 seconds, 110 to 120 degrees. (If you think you'll need to use the pot for something else, transfer the milk to a glass or ceramic bowl, or else you can let it sit in the pot.) If you're in a hurry, you can fill your sink with ice water and let the pot of milk cool in the ice bath, stirring the milk frequently so it cools evenly. Step 3 Transfer 1/2 cup of warm milk to a small bowl and whisk in yogurt until smooth. Stir yogurt-milk mixture back into remaining pot of warm milk. Cover pot with a large lid. Keep pot warm by wrapping it in a large towel, or setting it on a heating pad, or moving to a warm place, such as your oven with the oven light turned on. Or just set it on top of your refrigerator, which tends to be both warm and out of the way. Step 4 Let yogurt sit for 6 to 12 hours, until the yogurt is thick and tangy; the longer it sits, the thicker and tangier it will become. (I usually let it sit for the full 12 hours.) Transfer the pot to the refrigerator and chill for at least another 4 hours; it will continue to thicken as it chills. I've tried doing it on the stovetop and in my InstantPot on the sous vide setting. I've tried straining it, but it turns out like cream cheese. I think I have it the consistency that I want now with the InstantPot and no straining, but no matter what I do, I get lumps. Any suggestions would be greatly appreciated! Thank you!

For reference the kitten in question is 10 days old and weighed 232g (8.18oz) yesterday, and 237g (8.36oz) today. The others weighed mid 270g (9.52oz) yesterday, and around 285g (10.05oz) today. Would you supplement natural feeding or say it's small but doing okay? And if supplement bottle feeding is required, use the \u00e2\u0080\u0098kitten milk' I have, or hold out til tomorrow and get a dedicated powder formula from the vets?

At first, I suspected it might be my shampoo, so I switched it up, but unfortunately, that didn't solve the problem. I'm currently using an Aloe Vera shampoo because I trust Aloe Vera with my life LMAO. I then considered if it could be due to hard water in Germany, where I live, but we have a water filter and strangely, my mom's hair doesn't have the same issue. Btw my hair is currently thick and at chest length, hers is shorter. I've even questioned if I might be using too much shampoo, but I'm pretty careful about it and I also use a scalp massager to ensure it's properly rinsed out. I'm at a loss for what could be causing this persistent odor. Any advice or suggestions would be greatly appreciated! Thank you.

Sadly most everything that could go wrong with the pregnancy did. Right now she is struggling to produce milk so that she can breastfeed out son, which she so desperately wants to do as this is the last thing she can try and salvage some normalcy from in the whole ordeal. Unfortunately I am one of only two voices of encouragement she has to keep trying to breastfeed and get her milk production going while most of her family is pushing to just have her go to formula. I was hoping that other women here who have gone through the same thing could share their experiences and words of encouragement so she can see that this is not an uncommon struggle and that she is not failing as a mother because of something that is out of her control. We are aware that some of this maybe postpartum depression and we have scheduled a meeting with the hospitals counselor for tomorrow, but I would still love to show her that she isn't alone in this and outweigh the voices of negativity with voices of positivity for her. Update: I want to say thank you to everybody who commented. I showed my wife this post and all the comments you have all been leaving and that's made a huge difference already seeing how many people have shared her experience. I have already seen a positive shift in her while attempting to breastfeed, and she even  managed to get a good laugh in when our son fell asleep mid feeding even pumping since sharing this worth her has seen an upswing. I appreciate everyone who shared, you have all had a positive impact on both my wife and myself as well.

I'm a newbie in making icecream, I actually learned from my boss since october for a shop in my town. The owners want to expand and for doing that we needed to increase the solids in our recipes, so the owners wife (shes like a food engineer or something like that) helped us out and made a new recipe. Problem is the taste. We use the base for our 'cold' mix, so we use water at probably 70C now and it doesn't require eggs. It takes a bunch of cream too but the texture is great. But our mint is going downhill:( at least I don't really find it as tasty as before, it needs 2 times more flavor (we use a water based essence, well it surely has alcohol but none of them say what ingredients are used) and it still tastes like milk, with a fresh aftertaste of could be mint. It makes me sad \u00f0\u009f\u0098\u00a2 our white creams suffer too, but that essence is way stronger so it hasn't changed much, but the milk flavor just pushes through everything. Even the cherry one or our sky cream that has like wine and everything, those two are really strong flavours and it doesn't matter. I've read around that recipes still use whole milk, and a bit of powdered milk to help texture, but our recipe is made only of powdered milk, liquid sugar, emulsifier in gel and powder, the stabilizer, cream, dextrose and sugar. Anyone can help me out a bit? I want to understand better what's actually behind the ice cream so I can properly point it out to my boss and figure something out with the company that sells us the ingredients, maybe they have a standard recipe we could use?

Background: on day 3 he had to go to the hospital for dehydration and low blood sugar because I wasn't making enough milk, they kept him for 2 days because they were concerned about possible infection (in the end there was none) and started me triple feeding. Since then I've been trying to wean off triple feeding; I am making enough milk now to not need formula so supply isn't the issue; currently I offer the breast every feed, then we top up with bottle (slow flow, paced feeding) 4x a day, I also pump 4x a day (instead of previous 8). This is working right now, but I don't know where to go from here. We got a hatch scale and he gets anywhere from 30ml to 80ml in a half hour nursing session. It's frustrating that he knows what to do (it seems) but sometimes he's getting so little? He's also a bit sleepy at the breast and I'm doing everything I can (clothes off, tickling feet, etc) - it just makes nursing take a long time. Two LCs at the hospital said he has a good latch. Another outpatient LC said he has a bad latch. I think his latch is shallow because my nipple is compressed in shape after feeding, but it doesn't hurt. Pediatrician and LC are at odds whether his small tongue tie is worth addressing, I asked for ENT referral to evaluate and the next available ENT appt isn't until mid October. So what now? I am continuing to work on making sure we have as deep a latch as possible every time, and I've been told that as babies get bigger and stronger transfer can improve. Is there anything else I can try or ask about? I also welcome any positive stories from folks who have been in a similar place.
