It was only diagnosed a few years later, at which point i was already back to playing sports (volleyball) on a decent level. I never got surgery and always considered my \"ACL Knee\" my good knee to be honest, my patellar tentonidis on the other knee was bugging me more. Towards the end of 2022 i twisted my knee while landing again. It was not very painful but audible and felt like i was walking sideways for a second. After i took a step it snapped back and was a little stiff and painful for a few days. In the last year ive been trying to get back into sports after doing various amounts of rehab. From none at all, to 2 months without volleyball. Physio/only gym, depending on the resources available. I managed to compete in beachvolleyball throughout the summer and didnt have any issues. My problem is this: Doing certain movements causes my knee to slightly twists/lock. It can happen in a milly second when im just skipping or it can get painfully stuck in a slow motion like hip 90/90s. It\u00c2\u00b4s happened 4-5 times now, everytime (luckily) while doing these low impact things. My MRI scan still shows the barely visible ACL, a small meniscus tear, a zyst and a loose body. Some Orthopedics want to reconstruct my ACL, some fix the meniscus, some both, some tell me not to get surgery because i have no issues whatsoever in everyday life. I can bend, flex, retrain (slowly but it works). But i can\u00c2\u00b4t in good conscience perform my sport. If the twsisting happens again during a landing that might be it for my meniscus - but will a surgery help me with that? Has anyone else gotten surgery after such a long time? Im really scared it won\u00c2\u00b4t adress my actual problem and just add new ones. Of course I will keep consulting my doctors but I was wondering if anyone was in a similar boat with their ACL journey.

And I guess part grief/vent and part asking how those of you that had spread manage the changes? I've had CRPS in my Left foot for almost 17 years.  As far as the left foot I've learned to live with it, adjust, keep up with all my treatments etc. (you name it I tried it, and still do a very aggressive treatment regiment) I went through the grieving process (I was diagnosed at 21\u00e2\u0080\u00a6. To say my life changed drastically is an understatement) I had to relearn to walk, give up 5-speed cars, dirt bikes, skiing, adult softball and volleyball.  I gave up a very high stress high reward career and went on disability\u00e2\u0080\u00a6 i had to come up with different hobbies, and learn to deal with help where I used to be an extremely independent successful person, and my social life changed and shrank in ways I never expected. Through all that I really thought I was okay, and for the most part managing well. A few years ago I had minor spread to my right foot after a break, but I'd classify it as minimal, my current treatment regiment seemed to work. Well in the last year I've broken and torn everything in my R ankle and gone through 3 major reconstruction surgeries.  Through all that the CRPS in my r leg spread and worsened so so much.  Even with treatment I'm struggling mentally and physically. My care team has been great, and trying to be aggressive with CRPS treatment while giving my ankle time and space to heal. But I feel like I'm right back where I was 17 years ago. Maybe even worse off\u00e2\u0080\u00a6 because this time I KNOW (and my support system knows) what is at stake, and how drastic the changes can and probably will be. There is talk by my OT and PT of not being consistently able to walk, and preparing for that.  (Wheelchair, revoking my license\u00e2\u0080\u00a6.  Trying to find physically appropriate hobbies) I know I should dwell on what could be, or what could happen\u00e2\u0080\u00a6 but I can't seem to stop. Bottom line: I'm scared, and I feel trapped and I barely recognize myself from pre and post CRPS diagnosis. I honestly don't know if I can do the adjustments a second time, I lost/changed my whole identity the first time and barely came out the other side. So thank you for reading my pity party essay, and those of you who went from managed to massive spread.  How did you manage? How did you deal with and handle it?

I'm planning for the spring season, intending to wear thermal underwear and sports pants underneath (even though I'm not particularly fond of them, I understand that paint can wash out?). On top, I plan to layer thermal underwear, and a T-shirt with a sweatshirt, and purchase a tourist fleece jacket. What are your thoughts on this?
