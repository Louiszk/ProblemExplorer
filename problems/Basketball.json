First off, this season is very much still in the works. I will never rule out these boys, as they always can have a sneaky playoff run in them. It's not even sneaky at this point, since it has happened so many times now. Each player on the Heat, and the team more broadly, have shown many streaks of greatness throughout this season. The Heat have an unbelievable culture holding the fabric of the organization together which drives progress each season. We have an awesome group players that ride for each other. Most importantly, we undoubtably have one of the greatest basketball coaches of ALL TIME at the helm. So what's going on here? It has become clear to me that the issue with the Miami Heat is systemic. While we have the best culture, we must reflect on the core strategic component of the culture that is no longer working: our stout defensive approach has become outdated in today's NBA.  The Miami Heat are known for having rugged defense, having the most well-conditioned players, and ensuring that the team as a whole plays all out on every, single, play. This defense-first approach truly disorients other teams, and we do our best to build out our offensive proficiency from there. Unfortunately for us, the NBA of this modern era has changed significantly over the last 10 years. There are many players and many teams now that have sacrificed defense to put up offensive numbers that were previously unimaginable. 3 pt shooting rates have skyrocketed and final scores are ridiculously high these days. It is safe to say, that at this point, it feels like the Heat are constantly working from behind in these games. We always hold it down defensively, but the best teams simply score more. And at the end of the day, the team that scores more, wins.  It feels like we are old. It feels like we are trying to compete with the new, innovative NBA style. But it's not actually an age thing for us. We have a well-balanced roster in that regard. It's more about the approach. We still embody the 90s style of play, which has truly brought us remarkable success for many years. But now, it seems to be a tipping point. We're not keeping up in the same way anymore. Being so defense-oriented, in SUCH an offensive-oriented league has put our team at a significant disadvantage. Yes, we lack size, but at the end of the day, we generally just don't score as easily as other teams. Additionally, because we are so defense oriented, we have to work even harder to win games, which tires our guys out. Then, shooting percentages decrease because guys are more gassed, even with great conditioning. Then, there are more injuries because guys are going all out, which further leads to offensive woes. Lastly, at the end of games, when our defense keeps things close, it is harder to close those games without the same offensive superpower. It's a cycle that just feels difficult. It seems like an ridiculous grind for players and coaches. More than it used to. It's not sustainable. Overall, I think we need to take a hard look in the mirror as an organization. We don't need to change everything. We will always be Heat Culture and defense wins championships. But at the end of the day, we need to swing back to the other side of the pendulum and pump our roster with more offensive fuel. The pendulum hopefully will swing back to a well-balanced offensive and defensive approach. Also, we can't blame this issue any individuals here, players, Spo, or the front office. Blaming individuals is nonsense and that needs to stop on this sub. This is a systemic issue, and everyone needs to come together and make a strategic adjustment together. I honor that we have taken this strategic approach as far as possible, and we literally got to the finals last season, somehow, off of sheer willpower. I do think adding Rozier was a really good step in the right direction. Herro is healthy again and he is always a great scoring threat. Jovic is starting to play more minutes and that has been exciting on both ends of the floor. Bam is expanding his shooting, and Duncan is seemingly working through a back issue, so I hope he's back in his early-mid season form soon. Playoff Jimmy is awakening and is always dangerous. We could still make a run, so never count this team out. I'm just grateful to watch this team, as there will always be highs and lows. Most basketball fans either don't have a team in their city, don't like the team ownership/front office of their team, or their team just has a losing culture. We are lucky to have such a good organization with a winning culture for so many years. Nothing like Heat basketball. I'll ride with our boys through it all.

I would appreciate reviews and comments on this draft explanation: When the officials precisely follow the NCAA rules and approved rulings in certain venues, the 10-second backcourt violation becomes a defacto 9-second backcourt violation. But in other venues, this problem does not occur. The NCAA has not standardized the display truncation specification for the shot clock. Some clock displays (Type 1) reach 20 at 10 seconds after the clock is started, and other displays (Type 2) reach 20 at approximately 9.01 seconds after the clock is started. Approved Ruling 236 in the 2023-2024 Men's Basketball Case Book \u00c2\u00a0specifies that a 10-second backcourt violation has occurred when the shot clock display shows 20. This is the correct rule for Type 1 displays. For Type 2 displays, this is one second too early. Video evidence of this clock specification problem is easy to find. In this clip, we see a Type 1 clock in action:  https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F2UhejNskDk&t=108s  The Type 1 shot clock display ticks down to 0 at the precise moment the clock expires (at around 1:50 in the clip).\u00c2\u00a0 So, of course, it ticks down to\u00c2\u00a0 1 when one 1 second is left and it ticks down to 20 when 20 seconds are left. And, of course, the clock is stated at the 30-second point. Early in this next clip, we see the type 2 clock in action:  https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nnJ1RuMl_c8  The Type 2 shot clock display ticks down to 4.9 when 4.9 (or, perhaps 4.99) seconds are left.\u00c2\u00a0 It ticks down to 5 approximately 1 second before that. I infer that the Type 2 clock implements the mathematical floor function such that it ticks to 5 at approximately 5.99 seconds.\u00c2\u00a0 So, the Type 1 clock display ticks down to 20 at approximately 20.99 seconds. And, of course, the clock is started at the 30-second point. Hence, the display ticks down to 20 approximately 9.01 seconds after it is started. As evidenced by the second clip, the Dean Dome is equipped with a type 2 shot clock.\u00c2\u00a0 With approximately 3.3 minutes left in the second half of the recent 2/26/24 Miami-UNC game. RJ Davis caught an inbounds pass.\u00c2\u00a0 After a couple of passes in the backcourt, Cadeau took possession in the backcourt.\u00c2\u00a0 Cadeau passed to Ingram in the front court. But before the ball was touched by Ingram, the shot clock display ticked down to 20 and the whistle was blown after only 9 seconds of possession in the backcourt.\u00c2\u00a0 UNC was charged with violating the 10-second backcourt rule when, in fact, 10 seconds had not elapsed.\u00c2\u00a0 The officials did everything correctly according to the rules. The clock was started when RJ Davis touched the ball and the display immediately ticked down to 29 indicating that the time on the clock was 29.99 seconds.\u00c2\u00a0 This was not an officiating error, this was due to the NCAA's failure to standardize their shot clocks or adjust their casebook rulings. One quick fix is to modify Approved Ruling 236 to specify that a shot clock display of 19 (instead of 20) indicates the violation in venues with Type 2 clocks.

Our defense does not have to be hunted for mismatches because there is always mismatch for whatever guard are in at the moment with slow footed centers behind them.

Why risk wiping your whole team with airbursts when you could kill smaller enemies better with just about any stratagem without the risk? Why take up a strat spot for anti tank mines when the regular / incendiary mines already do a good job at killing enemies as long as you bring a flame thrower or something to finish off the heavies that make it through the mine field in a few seconds? Why not make the mechs powerful? They're the last strat you unlock in the menu! Not to mention, later difficulties have enough titans that a whole team wouldn't be able to call in enough mechs to deal with them all.

It's still crazy to me that a lot of so-called dropshipping experts promise you'll get rich in two weeks with hardly any effort. Let me tell you the truth: that's not how it works. I've made a lot of money with dropshipping, but I've also learned a lot from my mistakes. One bad piece of advice they give is to copy what other people are already doing. This is not a good idea at all. Usually, they tell you to look at what your competitors are selling and sell the same stuff. But think about it. If everybody copies what everyone else is selling, you will end up competing only based on product price (because it's your only differentiating factor) and your profit margins will gradually disappear - that's why the majority of product spy tools are, in my opinion, useless; I only recommend you use them for inspiration. So don't just sell what everyone else is selling. Instead, start by picking a niche (a specific topic or area). You can get a free guide with over 300 niches in the links section of r/PassionsToProfits . Next, get to know your niche well. Read that again. Get to know your niche REALLY well. Find every subreddit, forum, blog, FB Group, website or magazine you man and study it. Look at what product features they value, their product choices, what gear and accessories they buy and which are being advertised Look at which products they are already buying and look them up on Amazon. Read the NEGATIVE reviews to see what they DON'T like about the products they already use - this will give you ideas for better products to sell and it will also help you filter \"bad\" products After doing your research, go to sites like AliExpress and search for unique products that not many people are selling and that you think your target audience would love. Yes, it takes time and patience. Some of my best products were found on page 53 of the search results! Sometimes it took me two weeks to find a good product to sell. Here's a trick I use to find unique products on AliExpress: Almost all Ali sellers don't speak English and use translators for their product titles and descriptions. Sometimes these translators will use different words than the ones we're used to. Here's an example: Often you will find that Ali sellers will use the word \"choker\" instead of \"necklace\". What you can do is grab a Thesaurus tool (just google \"thesaurus\" on Google and go with the first one that shows up) and insert your search term - for example, \"basketball gear\" or \"basketball jewelry\". Look at what synonyms that website gives you and use THOSE to search for products on Aliexpress. The word \"choker\", for example, is indeed part of the list of synonyms the Thesaurus shows you for the word \"necklace\". You'll be surprised at the little gems you can sometimes find using this method :) I don't promise you'll find gold everytime you use it (most of the time it shows irrelevant stuff).

We learn what she did and where she was on: Thursday, Friday, Saturday, Sunday and Sunday afternoon but Sunday evening - what's probably the most crucial part - is glossed over. This timeline from LE has zero information about what the family were up to that evening:   Crawford said Asha went to bed around 8 p.m.   Electricity went off in the Degree's neighborhood just before 9 p.m., after a car wreck nearby.   We can expect a Sunday/school night to be low-key but very mundane details were included for the other days - e.g. Asha catches the bus to school . This shows me that there was sensitivity around Sunday night.  3. THE POWER OUTAGE.    A power outage, attributed to a car crashing into a power pole, affected the Degree neighbourhood just before 9pm, lasting till about 1230am. Power outages don't necessarily affect all buildings in the same area at the same time though. Based on first reports :     Her father said that the power went out around 10 and came back on around midnight Sunday. (This is consistent with the broader power outage).    My point again though is there's a reliance on what the Degrees say around when exactly the power went out and was restored at their house.   A digital clock would reset to show 12:00 (if power is lost) once restored. Let's say the power outage lasted until 11pm in reality at the Degree house - clock would say 12:00 once reset. Let's say the outage lasted until 1:00 in reality - the clock would show 12:00 once reset. This could have somehow confused the Degrees time recollection that night - or given them a very easy way/excuse to mislead everyone about the times from that Sunday night. Doesn't matter if they also had a watch or analog clock.   It's worth noting that later that Monday, the Sheriff said Asha may have got up while the power was out    EDIT: Sorry, I just relistened to her recent 2023 interview and Iquilla actually says outright- \u00e2\u0080\u009dI guess it was about midnight because the power kicked back on\u00e2\u0080\u009d and. \u00e2\u0080\u009dThere was a power jolt that's how I knew it was about 12 o'clock\u00e2\u0080\u009d . Huh? She's literally saying the power being restored is what told her that the time = 12 midnight. No, power doesn't magically get restored at 12 midnight and at this time only. As I said, the clock resetting could have somehow genuinely confused them at the time but it is so weird that Iquilla is explaining it later as if this logic is correct.  4. THE LONG-TERM REMINISCING.  Iquilla reminiscing 20+ years later about that Sunday night is difficult to consider accurate & reliable - because of the additional complexity created by genuine memory loss and misremembering (on top of any intentional misleading). There are some things that I'd expect her to remember clearly from that night/morning but her memories about things like relatives coming by, watching TV etc. could be interweaved from other occasions- not necessarily specific to that Sunday. As I believe the aftermath of the basketball game to be the trigger for Asha's disappearance, I unfortunately have great trouble believing they were sitting there as a happy family watching a basketball game together that night.  5 . THE 2:30AM NARRATIVE.  The narrative for what happened at or around 2:30am in the Degree house that night has always struck me as a little odd.  What was first reported :   Mr. Degree said that he checked on Asha at about 12:30 a.m. and she was sleeping in her bed.      O'Bryant told police that he saw his sister get up around 2:30 a.m. in her nightgown and go to the bathroom but then came back to bed.    LE's timeline published a few days later doesn't acknowledge O'Bryant last seeing her.   When electrical service is restored around 12:30 a.m., Asha's father sees both Asha and O'Bryant in their beds. The children sleep in the same room.Asha's father goes to bed around 2:30 a.m.    Later reports say    Her father said that he had checked on her around 2:30 a.m. and later her brother said he got up to go to the bathroom between the hours of 2:30a.m. and 6:30a.m. and he believes she was there.   On face value, I have less concern for Harold checking on the kids but so many questions about O'Bryant's account. Notice the change from Asha getting up for the bathroom to himself. Was it unusual for Asha (or him) to go to the bathroom or get up for any reason in the middle of the night? If he had been awoken by Asha moving about, it seems unusual he'd bother to look over and notice her apparel - did he sense something to be out of place? As O'B then apparently goes back to sleep and is now not disturbed by a squeak from his sister's bed and doesn't hear a sound from Asha allegedly leaving the house shortly after. Unfortunately his account just seems fabricated to me (my blame is not toward him as a 10 year old but the adults in this situation). Anyway, this all creates a little uncertainty around the crucial question- who last saw Asha & when?  6. THE CIRCULAR REASONING.  A couple of eyewitness sightings were provided of someone on the highway in the early hours of Monday - the first being at 3:45am. A common belief is the sighting must have been Asha because it lines up with the time she was last seen by her family at 2:30am. Also her family saying they saw her at home at 2:30am must be true because it lines up with when the eyewitness saw her on the highway at 3:45am. The fundamental problem with these beliefs is that both start with an assumption. You can't validate an assumption based on an assumption. This is circular reasoning. Basically, you'd be saying \u00e2\u0080\u009cX is true because of Y, and Y is true because of X\u00e2\u0080\u009d. The conclusion is inherently flawed. Both may still be true of course.  7. THE CHANGING BEDTIMES.  Some say that inconsistencies are due to memory loss over a period of time. I agree this can happen, depending on what the information is, but many of the inconsistencies in Asha's case are within the first few days and weeks -such as what time Asha went to bed.  until her father told her to go to bed around midnight - 15 Feb    Asha's father said the girl went to bed about 6:30 p.m.- 15 Feb    She watched TV in the den with the rest of family until returning to bed at 9 p.m - 15 Feb    Crawford said Asha went to bed around 8 p.m - 17 Feb   I would dismiss smaller differences e.g. 9pm vs 9:30pm - but a 4 hour variance is an issue. Note the last time (8pm) from the Sheriff - why did he simply change Asha's bedtime as if it to \u00e2\u0080\u0098correct' it? I believe her bedtime must have been around midnight per what Harold first stated. The  advantage to the Degrees with a 8pm bedtime = it conveys good parenting, disciplined children and a normal night. This doesn't apply in reverse i.e. no advantage to say Asha went to bed at midnight if she actually went to bed at 8pm. Plus there was the midnight lounging on the couch...  8. THE LATE COUCH LOUNGING.   Reported the first day    Asha's dad said she laid on the couch in jeans and a purple and white \"Sun Degrees hot in Atlanta\" T-shirt until her father told her to go to bed around midnight.   Why was Asha, whose bedtime was by 9pm on school nights , not in bed and still in day clothes at midnight? This detail weirdly disappears in subsequent news reports. I'm zeroing in on this not simply to be critical that Asha was up but because it shows irregularity in routine just hours before she was reported missing. It needs to be explained.  9. THE LATE NIGHT CANDY TRIP.   Reported by ABCNews GMA    <voiceover-reporter> about 1130, asha's father harold says he goes out to buy valentine's day candy. when he comes home, he watches TV, checks in on the children, and goes to bed about 230.   What's interesting is this aired 10 years later. It's unclear if he said this in 2010 or GMA were reporting what Harold had previously told LE. I cannot know for certain if this was the first time the candy trip was publicised but it makes very little sense for Harold to introduce this information ten years later. If LE's decision, I wonder why it was shared in 2010. Anyway - ultimately it does seem like an excuse. Harold simply making a late candy trip is plausible - but that's what makes it a good excuse for why he/his car may have been seen by someone at that late hour.  10. THE EARLY MORNING BATH.  From an interview with Jet magazine    <Jet> Can you share the basic facts regarding your daughter Asha's disappearance.   <Iquilla> I woke up on Feb. 14, 2000 at 5:45am. The alarm went off for my children to go to school at 6:30am. I went to the bathroom, two feet away from the door, to start the bath water because they could not take a bath the night before since we had a power outage.   This interview with Jet happened 13 years later. The detail about a bath was not out in the public sphere prior to this time, to my knowledge. From a Feb 2000 article    The typical day starts at 6:10 a.m., when Iquilla got up to get ready for work at Kawai American, a piano manufacturing plant in Lincolnton. She'd wake the kids up then, and they were responsible for getting dressed, fixing their own breakfast and brushing their teeth before going to school. At 7:30, Asha and O'Bryant met the bus..   It's unclear if usually the kids would be woken up at 6:10am (when she woke up) or after she got ready for work but just sharing how a typical day in the Degree household had been described. I will however point out she specifies the bathroom being 'two feet away from the door' . Why? I know Iquilla can be verbose with her responses but this detail seems extremely unnecessary. Why did the power outage at 10pm stop the kids having a bath? Unfortunately, this bath overall does seem like an excuse too. Perhaps someone saw movement at the house at an early hour? I suspect the commotion at the Degree household started much earlier than 6:30am. Because of all of this, I think it's worth reconsidering the window of opportunity [2:30am - 6:30am] in Asha's disappearance and asking what other explanations could exist for when this little girl went missing.

This is more of a rant than anything else. I love sports romance (I'm an athlete) but Wattpad college sports romance pisses me off. All the books are quite literally the same thing. The titles sound the same, the name of the characters look & sound the same, the plot line is the same, the motives are the same, and there is no effing originality. It's either the unnoticed FMC who ends up being partners with the MMC or the journalism major who either has to interview the MMC or is partners with him for a class. The MMCs are either basketball or football players and are ALWAYS white. They're also always on the way to making it to the NBA or NFL \u00e2\u0080\u0093 (One author pissed me off by saying that the MMC was drafted by like five different teams and he chose his favourite. Drafts do not work like that but whatever). The MMCs are always portrayed as manwhores and players just because they're sexually active and don't date. They always have a baby while still in college, get married, and live HEA as the MMC gets drafted. The number of books I read that follow this damn structure is frustrating. The sports are always ignored and the lack of diversity is atrocious. Considering that basketball and football \u00e2\u0080\u0093 at both the collegiate and professional levels \u00e2\u0080\u0093 are predominately Black-dominated, it's crazy to me that there's not a SINGLE black character in these books. You mean to tell me that this college football or basketball team is made up of all white people? And your entire starting players are all white? BFFR. While I'm a firm believer that authors should write what they want because it's their book, I also feel they should be realistic. When I read a hockey romance, I'm not expecting black players because hockey is predominately white. Sad but true. When these authors write a 6 series book with only not a single POC character or just a single short story containing a black MMC, I'm annoyed. The MMC's blackness is never explored. His culture and values are not explored. The necessity of code-switching to assimilate in various environments is not explored. If you removed the sentence that says the MMC is black, it makes no difference in the book. There is nothing differentiating him from the 6 other white MMCs in the previous books of a 10-book series. It's just bad representation and it makes me more upset than having no representation. I wanna hear y'all thoughts on the issue. Feel free to disagree. I want a genuine conversation that allows room for mistakes and understanding.  **Thank y'all so much for the recs and upvotes. I'll definitely check out some of the books.

As a guy who grew up watching mostly football and basketball, rugby seems so much better with its refereeing standards and video reviews. VAR in football is a joke and it's still better than not having it, despite what the old geezer at the pub will say, and NBA reviews are pathetically long and even more infuriatingly they just boil down to \"We made our decision and we're sticking to it, no matter how wrong it seems!\". When you complain about TMOs, do you have another sport in mind that does it better?

You are just in a dark room, and probably alone.\" \"Do you even play basketball? Not in reality. You think you do. But it's just an illusion.\" And this just goes on and on and on and on. Where is the end? I thought I would reach some conclusion or centeredness at the completion of reading the text. Not really.

I'm 21 years old and have been dealing with keratoconus, i suffer from blurry and ghosting vision. It's been tough, especially when I see my peers enjoying activities like football or basketball, things that I used to love but now find challenging due to my condition. Seeing others effortlessly engage in these activities while I struggle with something as fundamental as clear vision has been incredibly disheartening. It's hard not to feel left out or inadequate when I can't participate in the same way. It's like there's this invisible barrier preventing me from fully engaging in things that used to bring me joy. I know comparing myself to others isn't healthy, but it's difficult not to when it feels like my condition is holding me back from fully participating in life. It's not just about the sports either; it's about feeling like I'm missing out on experiences that many people my age take for granted. I'm trying to stay positive and focus on what I can do, but some days it feels like a constant uphill battle. I'm reaching out here in the hopes of connecting with others who might be going through something similar or who have found ways to cope with similar challenges.

Basketball was always something I was really good at growing up. Grade 7 and Grade 8, countless mvps in tournaments, 30pt games, I was under 5ft at the time which gave me a disadvantage but I always played well. Grade 9, I was around 5ft-5'3ft and started struggling with confidence. I would cook everyone in practice or scrimmages but when it came to games, I would struggle performing 100%. The games where my confidence was really good though, I would score 20+ pts. Grade 10 was Covid no ball but grade 11 was the first time I played SR. Varsity. We had scrimmage one of our first practices and I hit 15 3s. My confidence was through the roof that year coming into the season. I was cooking my teammates who eventually went D1 and D2. I was 5'5 at the time but I'm very athletic. I was the fastest on the team and was able to dumk off a lob. First game of the season, I came off the bench and got on. I lost the ball after 2 possessions and coach took me out and I didn't play for the next 5 games. We played a trash team and were up 101-28 and coach didn't put me on until the last 4 mins but put everyone else on. I always came to practices, always worked on my game, was nice to everyone, good grades, and didn't know why my coach never put me on.

One game I crossed someone up and made a jumper. Scored 6 pts in 3 mins. The next game I didn't play at all. Same thing was starting to happen like last year but I kept pushing through hoping that my coach would change. Last few weeks of the season. A game before playoffs; it was our senior night. Not really a shocker but I never played a single minute. Cried so hard that night. Playoffs came around. I started to play more and things were turning around. I would play 20+ mins our first game, and our second. I would play a lot again our 3rd game but we lost and our season was cut short. For the 10 months I have been struggling with the fact that I could've had so much better if I had a better coach. Everyone on my team was surprised and how little I played. I hated how my family would come to my games to watch me sit the whole game. I cried so hard after so many games.

But I'm not a \"basketball guy\" and these are teenagers and decent players.  (They won their first game last week with a stand-in temp coach.)  I watch basketball ocassionally, and know the very basics of the game, but will need to educate myself on all the fouls, strategies, techniques, drills, etc.  I'll definitely spend some time digging through this sub and online. More immediately, though, if I have to coach the boys at a game in the next few days, does anyone have any quick advice/tips/suggestions on what I should be looking for, telling them to do, etc?  I mean I can stand there, sub players in, and yell \"rebound!\"; but would appreciate any immediate advice that will help me provide a bit more value, at least until I can spend some time on it.  Thanks!

I decided that this year im gonna be serious and try and be good at basketball. I have done a few other sports in the past(including basketball) but It was nothing long term, and I was dogshit at all of them and didnt try or practice much at all. I didnt care about basketball at all until my parents signed me up for some practice last year, where I played for the first time. I had(still have) issues with procrastination so I didnt practice at all, or really cared about it. So like the lessons ended and I didnt do anything. I told myself that I would practice daily, but even though I had so much free time I didnt do anything, also I had no idea what I was doing or how to practice, nor did I have any friends to play with(or friends period) so I had no motivations and stopped. My parents really want me to play basketball and are disappointed that I dont. Like I already disappointed and failed them enough so I want to get good at basketball this year. Not like play on a school team or any high level or anything; I started too late for that. But my goal to be able to play decently well, maybe with some other kids my age. Anyway I found some 10 minutes handling workout on youtube so im just gonna try and do that everyday. Emphasis on try.

The instructions recommend a 36\u00e2\u0080\u009d deep x 16\u00e2\u0080\u009d wide hole that's flared at the bottom. Used a bobcat auger but hit a granite boulder at 25\u00e2\u0080\u009d deep.
