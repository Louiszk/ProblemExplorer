Drinking for me, became a REAL issue in my early thirties as I got older and less and less of my small social circle were spending their free time at pubs and clubs. It got that bad that immediately after work each evening, I would frequent my local retail store and became \"good friends\" with the sole Employee dedicated to the numerous alcohol aisles. We knew each other on a first name basis. He even knew my favourite drink (Duvel; A strong Belgian Ale at 8.5% alcohol content) and ensured it was always stacked on the shelves for me each evening so I didn't go without. Six was my minimum and 10 was my limit. It was costing me \u00c2\u00a325 a night whenever I bought 10 bottles. That was one of the REAL tell tale signs that I had a serious drinking problem. Becoming a regular and getting to know your local liquor store employees on a first name basis is a real indicator that you've got yourself a drinking problem. Did this ever happen to you? Did the Employee staff recognise you and knew your drink of choice? Did you ever wake up and realise that this sort of behaviour was a real problem and something needed to change?  UPDATE: This thread blew up way bigger than I had imagined. It's interesting to hear all the stories of everyone here and how all of us problematic drinkers have our own unique and sneaky ways when it comes to buying our booze. Thanks for sharing your feedback. Some stories here have been real insightful. It's also interesting to hear how store clerks all recognised and knew of all the frequent problematic drinkers no matter how hard we tried to hide our affairs.

My dad manages a liquor store and has been setting aside bottles here and there for the wedding so finding a place that we can provide the liquor but hire a bartender service is very important. We're looking at places that can fit at least 150 people and are located no more than like 45-60 minutes outside of the cities. We are not religious and won't be getting married in a church and we've already discussed that we don't really want to get married in a park. We toured Hope Glen farm and it was 100% perfect expect for the price. $12k just for the venue before food, photographer, music, and all the other things that cost money is a little out of our budget unfortunately. I've also been told that the Saint Paul College Club lets you BYO alcohol and I've contacted them but not toured the venue yet. Y'all know any other places that let you bring your own liquor and can just hire a bartending service? When I google things, I mostly get a lot of park results and that's not what we're really interested in. Thanks in advance for any suggestions!  Edit: You guys are amazing! Thank you all so much for the suggestions and info so far! I'm at work right now so I can't respond to everyone individually but I'm going to keep a running list here of the places suggested so far and I'll check them out after work :) Saint Paul College Club,  Semple Mansion, Neu Neu,  Plymouth Creek Center,  B&L Barn Wedding in Ham Lake, Glass House, Pique Event Space ( link ),  The Blaisdell,  Outpost in Chaska,  Paikka in St. Paul,   Germanic American Institute on Summit,  Brick x Mortar,  The Blaisdell Mansion, Camrose Hill Flower Farm,  Day Block Bonus advice to reach out to  equalpartscocktailco.com  who do tons of weddings around the cities and allow you to bring your own liquor and would know all the spots!

So a few years ago, I went a russian friend's house. While I was there, she offered me some of her special liquor that she made. I accepted and I must say, it's the best liquor I had ever tasted in my life (I love sweet drinks). It almost tasted like potent juice, it was super sweet, fruity and flavorful. I ended up drinking as much she was willing to give and went home very drunk. I've always thought about that drink since but the craving for it has hit HARD this year. We never stayed in contact (think she's traveling at this point now too, I'm not sure). Points, I MUST know what it is that she gave me so that I can recreate it. She told me the name in russian, but I was too drunk to remember. I have a few clues:   She's a beekeeper. I remember her mentioning honey was in the liquor.   I believe the base alcohol was vodka, but I'm not 100% sure.   The fruitiness comes from the fresh berries she left in alcohol to soak. I believe she put the berries (not sure which berries) in the jar with the alcohol and put it away in the cabinet for a month or 2.   May or May not be sugar.   PLEASE help me. A recipe would be great as well.
