Even the ethnic stores seem to fixate on the instant or bag tea here. No pu'erh to be found (not even bagged or separated loose leaf, much less cakes.... and the only \"oolong\" is Twinings and Bigalow (which seeing as I need SOMEthing to hold me over after my sprees at Yunnan sourcing and TeaVivre, those were it, and I know they're at least not bad if not necessarily what I'd consider true Oolong) The closest tea shop is about 55 miles away, and having been there I know their specialization is the flavors and blends that cater to Western tastes (Think things like Celestial Seasonings, or the fruit and spice blends, etc, along with some herbal tisanes) unless they've really changed in the last several years, which it didn't look like when I Googled them. Nothing wrong with that, just not what I'm looking for. While my uneducated palate can't YET discern much by way of the flavor profiles many talk about here for various oolongs and pu'erhs...perhaps because I haven't had access to even trying them, but I can't taste the differences between different black teas or different green teas either.... Unfortunately what I CAN taste is any time a flavoring is added, natural or otherwise, and it's just discordant with the teas in question for me, why THAT has to be the element I'm sensitive to instead of just enjoying, IDK.  If you do enjoy them, more power to you, anywhere we can get those simple pleasures is important these days! Just disappointed, but not especially surprised after my pilgrimage around our towns turned up nothing at any of the health food, ethnic, or specialty stores except instant and the big name generics. Ironically, Walmart itself had the best variety, was the only place with even the Bigelow and Twinings Oolongs, but was not especially inspiring. Anyone have any recommendations for good shops if I ever manage to arrange a train trip to Chicago? I suspect that's going to be my best bet if I ever want to see my selections in person before buying.

You infuse a vodka with black tea, milk wash it, then shake with 1/2 oz of honey syrup 1/2oz  lemon juice and a very tiny pinch of salt. The issue is it is coming out incredibly inconsistent. I think this may be due to the inconsistency of the salt I add but I have a hard time believing this small variation has such a large difference. One will be delicious, but the next may be borderline undrinkable (I of course drink it still). It's hard to describe the difference. I know the flavor that is overpowering the whole drink but I cannot give it a name. I kinda think it's the bitterness from the tea in the vodka, but it's not the same drink to drink. We're doing a tasting for  next months menu soon and even though it's cooling down and this is more of a summer drink, I want to at least put it up for consideration.

When you sing, other people compare your performance to the multi talented singers of the world, from YouTube to famous singers. Not only these people are extremely talented (which is why they are where they are), but also have had years of training the best money can buy. When you sing, other people who can't sing well, compare you to famous singers, so unless you have talent yourself and training under your belt, no one will say that you are a good singer. In fact, in many cases, you will have people saying you can't sing and mean stuff like that. It happens all the time, from online to the real world. Ironically, they themselves can't sing well either. As such, the standards are through the roof, then you have stupid shows like american idol which only make things much worse, where they idolize super talented people and mock/ridicule the ones who aren't as good. They set the example that is ok to mock someone who is not a super amazing singer. This is why everyone is fearful of singing in front of others, and if they can sing somewhat ok, they will downplay it. You literally need to be more talented than thousands if not millions and have training, for an average schmock (who probably isn't great at anything) to say you are a good singer, fact of life Ironically the same doesn't happen in instruments, you can be told you are a good guitarist or pianist by simply having average to intermediate technique. You can impress the average joe by simply knowing how to play a few solos or intermediate piano pieces.

They have been fast friends ever since they were paired together on the Starbase Fire Brigade. Mel was fascinated about humans, and Frank was willing to indulge him when he asked questions... most of the time. Mel'iarr puts down his tea. \"Frank, the Humans have been in space a long time right?\" Frank nods and sips his cocoa. \"That's what they tell us in school.\" \"So that means you've probably tried just about every method of propulsion in space, yeah?\" \"Actually, yes! This was one of my favorite topics as a kid. I must have absorbed everything I could find about it.\" \"Oh, so you could talk to me about your historical propulsion systems! Do you mind if we talk about them?\" Frank looks at his friend, surprised. \"I'd love to, but why?\" \"To settle a bet.\" Mel'iarr picks up his chamomile tea and glances at it. With a flick of his ears - like a shrug - he tosses his tea back, finishing it. \"You didn't jump to thrusters immediately and I know humans can be really inventive, so I assume you had some unusual ideas you tried out.\" \"Hmm. Okay, how about the Nuclear Salt Water Rocket?\" Mel'iarr chokes on his tea. Frank jumps up and pats his back. Mel holds up a hand and sputters. \"The what?\" \"Oh yeah, it's a great one! Take nuclear fuel, dissolve it in water, and then concentrate it to just under criticality - that's the point where fission takes place - and then squirt it into a chamber where it can achieve criticality and bam! Fission. Now, shoot that now superheated steam and heat from the reaction out the back, and you're making thrust.\" Unconsciously, Mel'iarr leans back in his chair. \"But, that's just sounds like a nuclear bomb that-\" \"-That's going off all the time out the back yeah. Worked really well.\" As he talks, Frank becomes more animated. He's gesturing and his eyes are shining. Mel'iarr's tail flicks worriedly.  \"It was tough to get the pipes lined up correctly to not cause an early criticality incident, but we figured that out - mostly - before we started using them. Only a few blew up, but when they did, hoo boy. You could see it practically everywhere in the system.\" Mel'iarr ears flatten. \"Wow. Um, okay. That was a bit more... intense than I figured. Do you have another one that's less...\" He thought for a moment. \"Insane?\" Frank looks off into the middle distance. \"Oh! I know one! It's an old one, but I always liked imaging using it. It's so old that it predates us leaving Earth entirely. An Orion Engine.\" Mel'iarr relaxes. \"That doesn't sound so-\" Franks gesturing nearly knocks over his cocoa. \"I love this one, it's so simple and elegant. You just make hundreds and hundreds of small nuclear bombs, shoot them out the back one at a time, detonate them, and ride the pressure wave forward and repeat!\" Mel'iarr's fur poofs out angrily and his ears flick forward. \"No. You're lying. You're just making that up.\" \"I'm not, check it out!\" Frank takes a moment to search on his pad, and brings up an archive video to show Mel. While they're talking, Mel'iarr's other human friend, James walks by. James and Mel'iarr work together in Environmental Processing. With the Starbase's low population, Frank knows him too, but they're not especially good friends. Mel'iarr gestures to the human. \"James! You have to help me!\" James looks down and the small, worried K'laxi. \"Of course Mel, what is it? What's wrong?\" \"Pen'men said that I couldn't find a problem that humans don't solve with explosions. I was speaking with Frank - from the Fire Brigade - and he started describing old human space propulsion systems that make me think that humans solve every problem with explosions.\" James raised an eyebrow. \"I mean space propulsion is by definition explosion based. That's a wild place to start, Mel. But okay, we can think of something.\"  As they're thinking, Kerry walks by. She works in the infirmary and plays pickleball with James. He waves as she walks by, \"Kerry! Give me a problem that we don't solve with an explosion.\" \"Uh, fire.\" Kerry offers. Mel'iarr shakes his head sadly. \"No, you've used explosions to blast oxidizer away from a fire, putting it out.\" Kerry blinks, impressed. \"Woah, neat! Hmm. cooking?\" Mel'iarr's ears droop. \"There's a ancestors cursed grain that explodes when you cook it!\" \"Oh popcorn, right.\" James sits down next to Frank and Mel and gestures for Kerry to join them. \"Oh! I've got one. Negotiation! Frank crosses his arms and looks satisfied. Mel'iarr gives him a look. \"I thought of that. What about intimidating the other side with an explosive based show of force?\" \"Damn! I thought I had it there. Okay okay....\" Frank picks up his cocoa, long gone cold, and takes a sip. James casts his head around the room. \"What about welding?\" \"Welding?\" \"Yeah, that's done with heat and electricity, but not explosions.\" \"I'm sorry James, I couldn't help overhearing.\" The Starbase AI cuts in \"But humans have welded with explosions. It's a known method in welding two dissimilar metals in extreme environments.\" Frank sits up and looks over at the Starbase interface screen. \"Woah, really? That's so cool!\" \"Frank, focus please.\" Mel'iarr says. \"We're looking for non-explosive solutions.\" \"What about medical issues?\" Kerry says. \"There can't be a lot of call for explosions there.\" Frank nods. \"Hmm, now we might be onto something. What do you think Starbase?\" \"Searching.\" A moment goes by and Mel'iarr allows himself a moment's hope that he has finally found a solution that doesn't involve explosions. \"Results found. Mel'iarr, the humans use Nitroglycerin - an explosive - to treat heart disease.\" All of Mel'iarr's fur poofs out in surprise. \" They do what? \" His voice is nearly a whisper. \"It helps prevent chest pains as a result of heart disease according to my records.\" Kerry holds up her hands. \"Wait. Wait wait wait. If we're counting nitroglycerins then we have to count electricity which can be generated by explosions.\" \"How in the name of my Ancestors do you generate electricity from explosions? Mel'iarr slumps back into his chair, defeated. \"We don't as much now, but electricity is generated from spinning a magnetic field, right? We had reciprocating engines that worked off of the explosion of refined hydrocarbons for hundreds of years.\" James looks at Mel and narrows his eyes. \"How did you do it at first Mel? You can't tell me you never developed reciprocating engines.\" Mel'iarr Looks up at James. \"No, we did, but they're different, they use temperature differential. Starbase, what's the human word for them?\" \"Stirling engines, Mel'iarr. Humans did develop them, but they decided that the exploding way was preferable.\" Mel'iarr puts his head in his hands. \"I don't know what's worse! That you have an exploding solution to every problem or that you both think they're all really neat! \"I can't help it Mel'iarr, explosions are cool.\" James looks kindly at his friend. Kerry agrees. \"It's probably why it's used as a solution so often.\" **** After the evening meal on that same day, Mel'iarr walks over to Pen'men while she's on her shift in Traffic Control, and silently hands her some currency. Pen'men looks up from her console and stares at Mel'iarr. Mel'iarr shakes his head. \"You were right.

I think the race is honestly clear who will win, but I don't want to disregard either side. If you have working eyeballs, you could see that I'm siding more that Cruz has a good chance to victory. With how polls are, Allreds campaign strategy, and the national atmostphere  \u00e2\u0080\u0094 it's clear to say that Cruz has a swell chance to win.                Now these polls aren't gospel by any means, I mean look at 2016 and tell me that the polls are always right. I do think it shows that there is a feeling that Cruz has a good chance. Relying on polls though aren't always the greatest option, so I want to divert the conversation to the main point of this post, and that being the issue with Cruz and the TX-GOP.  Cruz, Trump, And Succeeding At Failure  Cruz entered into the senate in 2012, coming off the back of the TEA party movement. Cruz was seen as the down-n-dirty type of candidate, for lack of a better word. He was everything that Texas wanted, a Republican who was strong against government and conservative on social issues. When Cruz ran in 2016, he became the torchbearer of the general TEA Party movement, and brought together all the parts of the movement that had collapsed since '08 and '12. His campaign against big government, the IRS, etc was his mainly strategy to kick Trump back to NYC. As we all know, Cruz failed. He fumbled, hit his head, and eventually bowed and endorsed Trump. TEA party members decided to follow Cruz, and became part of the Trump wave. With Cruz returning to senate, Trump in office, and the TEA party movement in shambles, Cruz had to keep going. Today, Cruz is very much who he was before. Small government, social conservative \u00e2\u0080\u0094 the TX-GOP dream candidate. This isn't to say that he is the candidate that all members love. 2024 has shown this better than any election.      Now on paper, this is seen as an impressive victory. But, if you peel back the layers you realize this isn't all too special. Cruz won 88%, but Gibson and Lopez gained 6% each (rounding up). In 2018, we didn't see this type of revolt against him. Mary Miller (not the congresswoman) ran against him, and she lost big time, but had a good showing. She only got 6% that election. This election though, two candidates got 12% against an incumbent. That isn't too impressive, I tell you what. In other primaries, we are seeing Republicans slowly start to fracture in Texas. No this doesn't mean Cruz will lose, but tit does point out that the TX-GOP is starting to stumble and fall. The scandals of Paxton, Cruz's vacations, and Trumps voter fraud claims are making loyalists more loyal and alienating more moderates. My opinion is, Cruz is screwed either way. If Cruz decides to return to his roots of being small government and socially conservative, but not 100% pro-Trump, he will run the risk of losing to a Trump endorsed candidate. But, if Cruz does not shift away, certain voting blocs could be at risk. Even though Cruz would not lose the primary, he would be a greater risk to lose the general. In short with this section, Trumpism is fucking Cruz over, but Cruz might be fucked either way.  Mister Allred Or How I Learned To Stop Hoping And Trust The Polls  Allred came into this election with drums blaring. He was seen as the front runner ever since he announced his campaign. Of course, there were people who were against his run, but their voices weren't as loud. Allred would go on to win the Democratic primary, to no-ones surprise. But the results and the minor details should be examined to understand how 2024 could go for Lil ol' Allred.      Allred won mostly farming communities and Conservative counties, with Guiterrez and Gonzalez won majority Catholic immigrant communities. This isn't to say though that Allred was 100% popular in the Conservative communities. There were small bits and pieces in certain counties that voted other ways against Allred. In my opinion, this shows he isn't the greatest candidate to pull moderate Conservative voters, but it doesn't rule out the chance.  David, Goliath, And Everyone In-between  With everything said and done, who has the best chance? I would say Cruz does. I already showed how he isn't promised his future in the TX-GOP, and is at risk either way. I also did show that Allred is an okay candidate, but isn't too strong. All together, Allred's biggest failure is the fact he isn't Beto. He doesn't bring in as much money at Beto did, his campaign isn't gaining as much ground as Beto did, and people are needing to learn who this Allred fellow is. Cruz is established, he's known for his perks and his warts \u00e2\u0080\u0094 there isn't much to be laerned from Cruz. Cruz has many ways to attack Allred, but that would make Colin seem like a bigger threat to Cruz than he actually is. What Cruz is doing right now is good, making sure to run on the fact he's an incumbent and run on the polls. What Teddy can't forget though is that incumbents aren't always promised everything. Cruz can do what he did in 2016 \u00e2\u0080\u0094 stumble and fall. His future is uncertain, but for now, he's alright.

Everything was going great for the first 18 months but for the past 3 months she has a huge issue with my parents. We don't live together at the moment, that was the plan but these issues have put that on hold. For the first 18 months we did lots together at the weekends, her mum and step dad got on great with my parents and we did BBQs and popping over for a cup of tea at weekends and things like that. We all went on holiday in June and it was ok but my girlfriend had issues with my parents doing things like my dad would cook a breakfast each morning, but always asked if anyone wanted one rather than force it, also my parents thought we would all put money in for food shopping for the villa. My girlfriend really kicked off about this and wanted each couple to buy their own food. This ended up with us having loads of the same items which was mad but I spoke to my mum about not making a fuss and just go with it. Just before the holiday my girlfriend said she didn't want to see my parents as much, which I was upset to hear it was too much in the first place but I didn't have a huge issue with it. When we got back off holiday she carried on saying it's too much, but she started to say other things about she finds it completely weird that my mum hugged me in public on holiday and that she finds them too much and finds my mum too much. This caused an argument as I can't help if I'm close to my parents or if my mum wants to hug me. Since then, I've stopped seeing my parents at the weekends completely, which they are upset about but I go over for dinner once in the week to still see them. She now goes quiet and a bit unresponsive on the days I go over, and has made me cancel going on a day she wanted me to go to hers for dinner, which I did. I have tried to get us back to being happy whilst not seeing my parents, she works a tough job and I do everything I can for her when I spend evenings and all weekend with her. I cook, help with her kids, run her a bath after a hard day, do the shopping for her. I did all this on Friday and after dinner I text my mum just letting her know what we were upto at the weekend, she saw this and instantly got in a mood with me for texting whilst I was with her. We then argued as it's been 3 months now where I can't see my parents at the weekends, she gets in a mood on the night I go for dinner and now if I text my mum. Just looking for some advice as she is now breaking up with me and keeps saying I have an unhealthy obsession with pleasing my parents and I don't prioritise her. There are a few other things we have argued about, I used to run twice a week with a friend from work, she is a female I have no interest in, but we ran as work friends for 6 years before I met my girlfriend. She said it's completely disrespectful and unacceptable so I stopped running with my work friend completely and I understood it made my girlfriend uncomfortable. But I never thought she would have an issue with my parents when we all got along so great for the majority of the relationship. Is this fixable? Should I cut off my parents more than I have?

My partner Cinder is a lovely person who I've been friends for about 10 months. They're partnered with a married couple, Rio and Tea,  for 3 months in addition to having a boyfriend, Kanvas, of 5 months. It's a lot to adjust to, but I really care about them and I'm down to try. I interviewed my poly friends, took notes, read a lot, watched some videos, and prepared myself as best as I can. This weekend, the entire cule went to an event 1.5 hours away to support Cinder. They'd said they would be going back home alone that night, even though Tea and Rio wanted to spend the night with Cinder, in an attempt to avoid showing favoritism. We had lunch, dinner, hung out, and at the end of the night, Cinder invited all of us back to their apartment. I was a little surprised and confused. Kanvas had to leave, but Tea, Rio, and I expressed interest. I thought it could be good for us, enjoy talking with Tea, and if I'm honest, would've felt left out if I just went home. Before plans were finalized, Rio declared they wanted to go and didn't want to stand around the parking lot any more. We split up to drive home, Cinder getting a ride from the married couple back to their car. I drive for over an hour without hearing about the night's plans. I gave Cinder a call. They answered laughing with Tea and Rio in the background. The call ended mysteriously for some reason. They called back. They were still in the car at the parking lot more than an hour away. They confirmed that I was alright and after listening to Rio go on a laughing rant about how they thought I hung up on them and were so worried I was mad, I gathered they'd had a big relationship talk and arrived at a better place which was good. I frankly don't care much for Rio but was glad they were feeling better and that the cule was more stable, but also felt pretty uneasy that plans had changed and that I wasn't told. I told them all to drive safe, went home, and sat awhile trying to process my feelings. Cinder let me know they were on the way home and I told them to drive safe. At 2 in the morning, they texted \"I is home safely.\" I was in bed and didn't reply. This morning, Rio messages me on discord that he'd gotten food poisoning from dinner and thrown up a bunch, especially at Cinder's apartment, which means they'd all gone home together. I think he was trying to bond over humor. I was pretty hurt and angry. Cinder invited me to go out today and I declined politely. They've got a performance improvement plan scheduled for tomorrow and I don't want to stress them out while so many things are falling apart in their life, but I feel like this was a breach of my boundaries. I've emphasized several times to them that I don't need to be #1 in their life, but especially won't be deprioritized for other relationships except in cases of emergency, or if there's communication beforehand. I feel like I was underhandedly disinvited and neglected, and possibly misled on purpose. Thing is, if they'd told me what they wanted to do, I 100% would've been in support. I've told them if they need to dedicate time to their partners, I can be flexible, but giving me a heads up about plans and expectations is important. What hurts is that I don't think they even considered my feelings, and am afraid that they were intentionally vague about their return journey home, or that they had gone back with their partners. It feels like a secret, and I don't know what to make of Rio's random discord message this morning. 6 weeks in, I have a feeling that poly is actually doable for me, and that I've been able to overcome jealousy and maintain good communication, but this relationship just isn't going to work. I love Cinder for sure and many of their actions show they deeply care about me, but I'm consistently getting hurt in ways that seem avoidable from a thoughtful partner. I don't think Cinder has any idea I'm upset. I'll talk to them about it this week when things are a little calmer and they don't have this PIP looming. It just fucking sucks, feels like this might just keep happening forever, and eventually I'll exit the relationship for my own wellbeing.  TL;DR, hinge partner invited entire cule back to their place after an event, stayed behind with a couple, didn't communicate changes in plan, and went home alone with them after and didn't mention it.

We also do a small amount of beverage formulation on the side, although we are not full-scale beverage formulators. I have a project that we are working on for an RTD tea so I am learning all about tea! We already make a 36-hour cold-brew herbal tea and a hot brew yerba mate for a few clients but we are struggling with cloudy black tea on this specific project. To explain the process a bit, it is common in the co-packing world to make a \"throw\" or concentrate of a specific ingredient, especially if it requires heavy mixing or brewing. We might make a 3:1 or even 4:1 concentrate before mixing it with the rest of the water for the batch. So, for example, if you are making 200 gallons of tea, you would brew all the tea for your batch in a 50-gallon hot tank and then transfer the brew to a larger tank and add the remaining 150 gallons of water. (This is done for many reasons but mainly because large brew tanks capable of reaching >175F are expensive and very energy-demanding). So, that leads me to the problem we are having. We are experimenting in the lab with some small batches of brewed black tea using a 4:1 throw but we keep getting cloudy or murky tea when it is chilled to 34-38F. Of course, when I heat it back up to 120-140F it turns clear which likely means the tannins and caffeine are bonding together causing the cloudiness when chilled. We are testing tastes with pure Assam, a blended tea similar to English breakfast, and Yunnan black teas. So far, Yunnan is the only one I can keep clear. The others all go cloudy. We experimented with brewing temperatures between 195F to 205F and brew times of 3 and 4 minutes. All with the same cloudy result. I have tried letting the tea concentrate cool to room temperature before refrigeration but to no avail. I also checked the water (commercial RO system) and there is basically no calcium or magnesium in the water (<0.6 mg/l). I suspect that the issue is there is too high of a concentration of tea compounds for the amount of water in the throw but I am wondering if anyone out there has experience with this issue when creating a tea concentrate.

I made a reddit account specifically for this question but here goes. I run a small town up and coming coffee bar and for the fall we're gonna try serving some seasonal drinks. Now coffee/espresso is completely my forte,  but when it comes to tea I am completely in the dark. I wanted to serve a hot tea that has fall, (and winter for a bit down the road), flavors and aromatics. I was also wondering what the process, or how hard it would be, to make tea bags in house. Thank you!

Today I tried an oolong from a local store, expecting it to be on the \"blacker\" side, but it turned out to be a \"greener\" (I noticed that I'm not a big fan of \"grass feeling\") oolong (this one if you are wondering) . Long story short, I've decided to get an introduction sampler kit from Yunnan Sourcing to dive straight into the source. Now I'm wondering which specific set to go for Knowing my preference for darker teas, do you think I should try their black tea set, explore the \"darker oolongs,\" or maybe venture into their introduction to Puerh?
