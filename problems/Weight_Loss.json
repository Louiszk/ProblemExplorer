I'm tracking everything I eat and weighing myself daily. I also track all my exercise but I know MF doesn't use it. The problem I have is that MF keeps reducing my expenditure. I think because my weight hasn't been going down. It's at the point where it's estimating my expenditure is about 2100 where it's actually about 3100 (according to apple watch and oura ring). So the 1750 calories or so it wants me to eat is just two little for me. I also say this just intuitively.... I'm 6'2\", weight 2017, and am exercising 2-3 hours a day or more, burning   an average of 1,292 in active energy per day, with a resting energy of 1822, yet my MF expenditure is 2109 kcal and it's suggesting I eat 1750. To add insult to injury, I totally see why MF is doing what it's doing based on my weight trend and calorie intake. I've only lost about 0.4 lb in the past week despite an on paper deficit of over 10,000 calories. The last time I used MF I didn't have this problem and it estimated my expenditure at like 3500. Part of the issue may be that I started taking creatine soon after I went back to using MF, so I probably put on some water weight while only eating about 2100 calories per day. But that started nearly two weeks ago so I would have thought my expenditure would have turned around by now. I'm concerned MF is suggested too few calories for me and it's hurting my metabolism and overall something seems off since 2109kcal is basically my resting metabolism and I exercise a massive amount.

(Male, 18) I started working out around a year ago. I was extremely skinny (55kg) and it's hard for me to gain weight, even though I consume enough calories, even more that I should. That's what basically lead me to taking creatine, as I've read it can help you with muscle gain (I understand it's not a permanent solution). I started somewhat over a month ago, before taking creatine I already managed to go up to around 67 kg (but ideally I want 75-77). I took it every day around 5-7g (no loading phase). And been working out 2-3 times a week. And the thing is I haven't noticed much change. I wasn't more energetic or lifting significantly more. I haven't noticed much muscle gain as well. Visibly my muscles doesn't look bigger. I did gain maybe like 2kg since i started taking creatine (now I'm around 69kg, but it's hard to track, since I can get different measures even thoughout the day). And now it's the hair loss problem. I went to the shower a few days ago and noticed 4-5 times more hair loss than I usually have. I have a long hair, so it's obviously noticeable. Anytime before it wasn't like that. I shower every second day, I would've noticed that. These 4 days my hair is shedding like crazy. If I run my hand though my hair, I will have like 5-10 pieces of hair on my hand. I think it's getting more thin as well. I'm really stressed out and getting depressed now. Obviously, I don't want to lose my hair. I have NO history with baldness in my family. Even at elderly age my relatives can grow hair. And people usually compliment my hair and say it's full and thick. I only did some surface level research on creatine beforehand (yes, it's rather my fault). But obviously it was some bs about that \"it's well studied and there is actually no scientific proof that creatine can cause hair loss, so it's safe\". Now I understand that it causes high DHT levels which can lead to hair loss. Sure, I can't be 100% that it's creatine causing it in the first place, but I never had anything like that before. And I haven't added anything new to my routine besides creatine. I'm never touching that thing again. I'd rather stay skinny (even though creatine didn't help me to gain weight anyway) than lose my hair and damge my mental health. And wouldn't even touch that stuff If I knew before. I don't know what to do now. Visually it's not that visible, cuz long hair, but shedding like never before. I've read it takes 4 weeks for creatine to leave your body. But is there anything I can or should do now? I been using rosmery oil a few times a week, but I've been doing it even before I used creatine (for my eyebrows mostly, but I applied on my hair as well), I think it darken my eyebrows a bit but rather then that not much (I'll still continue to use it anyway). And after all I still want to gain muscle weight and hit the gym. I'm not sure if I should now. Honestly, hair might be my first priority. I've been feeling a bit down that I couldn't achive much success in the gym when I started taking creatine in the first place (yes, I understand that over a month is not that long) and now it's the hair loss. So did anyone had simular experience? I'd really appreciate your support. Also I hope this post can be a warning for those who think about taking creatine. I will try to keep it updated.

Sometimes I can be eating something that I enjoy and want in that moment but then suddenly my brain tells me it is gross and I can't put it in my mouth anymore. Other times when I feeling overwhelmed and am hungry I will try to look for something to eat but all food becomes gross to me. I spiral more and don't eat.

I don't have any texture issues. I'm not trying to starve myself. I'm not binging and purging. I just get sensory overload and don't find food appealing. I am consistent with my meds and DBT therapy but it's not enough. So I made the call to my local eating disorder clinic to see if they could help me. I wasn't sure if my issue would be a big enough issue for treatment. I had to fill out like 8 different forms before my appointment.

I'm not a breakfast person and I hate the feeling of being forced to do something. So this is definitely going to cause tension. I might just tell them yes I did eat something when in reality I ate at 11. I did not tell her that I am trying to lose some pounds (nothing drastic or anywhere near being underweight. ) as I don't see that being a fruitful conversation.

I've been seeing a therapist via Zoom since January. She is the third therapist I've had since Covid started, and I chose her because, like me, she's around menopause age, and that's something my other therapists couldn't relate to. One of the things we often talk about is my issues around food and exercise. Something my therapist will do is if I bring up an issue, she will immediately throw out an idea that is very wacky. Such as, when I told her I was having financial problems, she suggested I could start an OnlyFans and post feet pics. When I tell her I don't want to do the thing, she immediately refocuses and we talk about options I can take, but one thing really has me wondering. I have physical pain brought on by my body size. I have trouble walking because of my extra weight. I have mental blocks around buying and preparing food, and I gravitate towards junk food. When we really started talking about this, my therapist was very excited to tell me all about her upcoming weight-loss surgery. She did ask, \"Do you want to hear about it?\" and I was curious just to find out how it worked. But I have never, nor would I ever, want to get an elective surgery. When the topic came up again later, she asked, \"Ok, so you wouldn't get weight loss surgery?\" and I said, no, absolutely not. So the next suggestion was, I should talk to my doctor about other weight loss options. What seems apparent is that my therapist isn't at all familiar with the concepts of HAES, Intuitive Eating, or anything in that realm. I detest diet culture, I hate the idea of working with my doctor because my health-plan has a deal with Weight Watchers, and I've already availed myself of all the various weight-loss support groups my plan offers--but there are times when I feel like my foray into HAES has actually hurt me, rather than helped me. The last \"diet\" book I read was \"The Fuck It Diet\", which really leaned hard into \"eat whatever you want to\", and after I read it, I did just that, and quickly ballooned up (transitioning to permanent work-from-home didn't help). I'm close to crippled when I try to move around. So I'm still on the fence about what approach to take to return myself to a state of being able to walk more than a couple of blocks without serious back pain and shin splints. The question is, is my therapist doing more harm than good? I like her a lot. She is very supportive and understanding of trauma and how that informs our coping strategies, but I worry that I should have put more effort into finding someone who understands HAES. (I am stuck with choosing providers from a limited list, due to my insurance; I cannot afford to see just anyone.) Thoughts?  ETA: You guys really came through. I have more clarity on what's up. I'm seeing this person more as a friend (and I think she is encouraging that) and that's why I'm sad about losing her, but I think she is undermining her attempts to convince me of my worth by injecting her own insecurities. I plan to stop seeing her but will have one last talk to express my problems with her approach. Thank you.

Corporation elects before June 25th to pay out a CDA dividend where the calculation at that time was a balance of $500k. On July 1, the corporation realizes a capital loss of $750k. For the year ending December 31, the income inclusion should be: ((1M x 50%) - (750k x 66%)) = nil (roughly) However, in reality, only 50% of that loss is usable due to the weighted average gain rule.

I've got very bad loose skin. In the past I made a loose skin and dating thread that got over 900 comments. I was okay for a bit after, now I've spiralled again a bit and I made a thread saying looking for support as I felt I'd wasted the best years of my life being obese, that topic got over a hundred replies. A lot of the replies on both topics  were helpful, but a lot were aggressive and felt like an attack. I got told I was uploveable because of my negativity. I was told that no one would want to be around me because of pessimism. I was told it certainly wasn't my looks that made me lonely. Essentially by a lot of people I was told to shut up and get therapy, as if that's a sure fix. I've been in therapy for years, it's not a pill you take where you suddenly become all better. I see on the top of the loseit page a thread ranting at people who are scared about loose skin. A lot of people in that thread are saying how that fear is just an excuse not to lose weight and they're being lazy. I'm a little shocked to see a sub that's meant to be supportive be so vitriolic to people struggling with certain body issues. You'd think struggling with weight would lead to an empathy but it's almost like if you're not entirely positive and optimistic about every aspect of losing weight you're the enemy. I wanted to create a thread offering a different view point about loose skin and aesthetic concerns about losing weight. I wanted to say as someone who's lost the weight and is struggling mentally with how I look, it's okay. If you're a the start of your weight loss journey are terrified of loose skin, that doesn't mean you're lazy, or looking for excuses to lose weight, or you're insulting people who've put the time in. It fucking sucks weight loss is a ramifications of obesity, its a consequence I wasn't aware of when I first got obese, people don't talk about it much. Maybe you weren't aware of it either, it's okay to be horrified about the idea of it. I was, I'm living with it and still am. I think one thing people don't understand for obese people, when they say oh you can hide loose skin with clothes, as if that's a fix all, like you're never gonna take clothes off. The thing that really sucks, and really scare me at the start of my weight loss journey was if my loose skin is bad thats it, I'm fucked. Obesity you can fix, loose skin, if it's bad you're stuck with. Saying we'll it's better to have loose skin than be obese is probably true, but obesity you always know with enough work and mental dedication you can  beat, you can't beat loose skin. That's terrifying. You shouldn't feel judged for feeling that way. I personally as someone who's been obese, was terrified of loose skin, and lost weight and now have loose skin feel you should lose the weight. It breaks my heart daily how I look, how I feel ill be single for the rest of my life because of it. It breaks my fucking heart, and you're allowed to feel that pain too. You don't have to, but I won't judge you. Having said all of that I'd rather have a broken heart and get to sit and read comfortably and get to walk without breaking into a sweat, and go to the gym and not fear a heart attack. It's hard to live like this, it's better, but it's still hard. I feel like we need to sympathise with people who are struggling with pessimistic thoughts more on here. Not attack then for challenging the belief that everything about weight loss is always, in every way positive. We need to give space for people spiralling into the places of the mind that are filled with monsters hiding in shadows. We need to not judge then and be patient. I say this as someone who lives in those dark placed of the brain a lot and I can tell you people telling me to grow up and loose skin is a badge of honor that I'm a bad person for not being proud only forces me, and probably others, down into the abyss more. Look if you're reading this and you have loose skin or are scared of getting it, I'm just saying I'm here for you. You're allowed to struggle, you're allowed to feel sad, you're allowed to want to cry and beat up a pillow (which I've done) but I think you should still try to get you're goals, whatever they may be. Don't be paralyse yourself with misery if you can help it. And if you can't help it then know there's one person (me) who doesn't judge you because I'm paralysed with misery myself. Stand tall if you can, crawl if you have to, claw if you must, just try to keep moving  and if you can't then know there's  other people out there who aren't moving and they don't judge you and don't think less of you because of that.

Now my shorts are getting a bit too big for me, they still hang on but are loose and will def be too big for me in a month if I continue on the same path. It's already getting a bit uncomfortable. Now I know that ideally they should fit like a glove, but I'm not super excited about the idea of buying a new pair every couple of months. If you had to choose, would you rather wear a pair that's a bit too tight or a bit too loose? Also, is there something else I should take into consideration, fit-wise?

Some background on me. I'm 26yo with a current weight of 345 lbs. Biggest iv ever been. About a year ago I was given a sample pen of ozempic and worked great but when the sample ran out my insurance refused to cover it. I jumped thru all the hoops and finally got a PA for saxenda. Unfortunately insurance would only pay half. Over $500 a month is just insane and not possible on my budget. I started going to a weight loss clinic and was getting what I'm assuming was a salt version of semaglutide. The weight loss I seen with the compound was just not worth paying 35 a week for so I stopped. At the beginning of this year I found the discount card for zepbound and got it. Called my insurance to verify out of pocket price but the medicine had not been added to the formulary. I have been checking about every month with insurance and finally today I found out it's been added. Insurance will still only pay half around $470  and the discount card will take off $150 a month.

I am looking to burn fat/lose weight as I have gained about 40 pounds of fat. I just started keto and signed up for Equinox last week. I feel like when I go I have NO idea what to do! I just wind up walking briskly on the treadmill. Any tips on beginner classes or the videos on the app that will help? Simple work outs for beginners that are overweight? I'm extremely out of shape, I cant do a single push up. I can do sit ups and low weight lifting with free weights. I'm F/31 and currently at 170 pounds and I USED to be 120. I got up to 200 IBS during covid. Any help or suggestions when it comes to classes for beginners or easy workout routines that you started doing when you first started to get active and had no endurance would be amazing. Thank you guys!

All of her life she has had a healthy weight, a nice slim sausage she was until I had a few health issues that landed me in hospital for a long while. I was in there for basically a year- this meant I had to leave my girl at the only place I knew she would be loved and cared for as much as I would've while I was away: My parents house. They adore her- she's their favourite four legged friend and while I was in hospital they treated her like gold- HOWEVER, they also fed her a ridiculous amount of food (My parents are euro so every time they'd see her\u00e2\u0080\u00a6 queue the \u00e2\u0080\u009c She's too skinny! \u00e2\u0080\u009c because she was slim & healthy.) in the time she was with them she's gained about 3-4 kilos & has gone from 5/6 kilos to 9/10 kilos (roughly estimating) So now, I have to try and get her back down to a weight that won't affect her bones. I take her for walks twice a day & play with her during the day as well as try and keep her on a new diet. They were feeding her boiled sausages & dry food. The dry food was one for big dogs ( they have a amstaff) and they leave a full large bowl out for her to constantly graze on which she never had before so she just gorged herself until she became a kransky. ( I was absolutely mortified when I found out her food regime at my parents but they took her in with love & she was happy so as much as I suggested to please feed her less or give them what I would feed her they refused because \u00e2\u0080\u009c she is happy eating that and Manfried (their dog) eats it too.\u00e2\u0080\u009d ) I've started her new diet which consists of; DINNER: 1/2 cup of science diet kibble for weight loss (Dachshund specific) with omega 3 oil & fish oil mixed with 40 grams of wet food (Royal canin dachshund specific) and an egg cracked on top. Breakfast: 1/2 cup of the same kibble with omega 3 & fish oil and 40 grams wet food. Constant access to fresh clean water changed 2/3 times a day. ( this has always been the same since she was a pup) No treats throughout the day. Is this too intense or relaxed of a diet? What can I do to improve? I just want my pup to be the healthiest she can be so any suggestions are welcomed. We are in Aus btw.

His main issue is food, he enjoys the actual workouts, but has something of an addiction to drinking sweet stuff and a lot of fried food. Hes getting progressively sadder about his lack of progress (he has depression, medicated. It still affects him though.) My issue is that I don't know how to motivate him without making him feel bad, and it kinda breaks my heart to do that. I'm not forcing him to do this, I told him my preference and he is doing this himself, but I don't know how to motivate him. Any suggestions are really welcome! (For clarification, he's seeing no progress in that he isn't losing weight. He seems to be trading fat for muscle pretty well; he is seeing strength improvements but weight is the big issue for him.

Like she lost 45 pounds or so. I knew she was eating less but I thought it was in a healthy manner. For example if we got fast food she would get a burger and either not get fries or share them. Come to find out she has only been eating a 1000 calories or so a day for months according to what she was tracking in the Fitbit app. I don't know how accurate she has been tracking either because I didn't know she was until today. She weighs 116lbs and is 5'4\u00e2\u0080\u009d. I am going to talk to her tomorrow about how eating so little is not healthy but I need some info. According to a tdee calculator she should weight between 120 and 130 and consuming 1600 calories. Is this accurate? Also my worst fear is she might have an eating disorder and I don't know how to tell. Do I call her pediatrician tomorrow? Do I address her calories with her and see if it was just ignorance? I don't want to give her a complex and I feel like I got to be careful in how I approach this. Also if there is a better sub for this please let me know. Edit. She is 14. We are going to talk to her and come from the side of giving her information. Meaning there are healthy and unhealthy ways to lose weight, be into fitness, etc. I just wanted to get a better understanding of what a healthy weight range was so I could show her the correct calories via a tree calculator. I understand 1000 calories too low. If she is combative I am scheduling a doctor visit right away. Edit #2 We have never criticized her weight. Both my wife and I had parents that were critical of our weight for different reasons growing up. She was 160 last year at her checkup and she was 130 this year at her checkup. The doc asked her about her weight loss and she said she was making better choices. Drinking water instead of soda. If she got a treat, instead of getting a shake she would get an ice cream cone. She wanted to go on walks and be a little more active. None of that screamed a problem. To us at the time we didn't think that was bad. We didn't know she was counting calories until recently and we didn't know she was trying to stick to a 1000 calories. We want to approach this a loving caring way. Hence why I asked about tdee and what is a healthy weight range. If 115 is okay for her gender and age that is fine but she needs to eat more and do this in a healthy manner. Final update. We have an appointment to talk to her pediatrician tomorrow(not with her) to get some advice on how to move forward and approach this. We were going to talk to her tonight but decided to wait until we talk to her doctor. Appreciate the input from you guys.
