There are so many cool passives I want to unlock, but you only unlock them by USING the given pokemon. Which means by the time you unlock it, you either a) already cleared classic with the pokemon, or b) already have a long endless run started with the pokemon in your party. In both circumstances it feels lame starting a new run from 0 with that pokemon even if they have the cool new effect, and you'll probably want to try out new pokemon by that point anyways. Basically what im saying is that the system is cool but rn the few mons ive unlocked passives for are the ones I am the least interested in starting a new run with just because it means ive used them so much already. Wish there was a remedy to this because the passives are honestly pretty awesome. Anyways, this game is still dope and shoutout to the dev(s), at the end of the day this is merely a nitpick.

Something that would not be clear when directly comparing vehicle stats or current cost but should be heavily considered. During high pop hours for each faction, the chieftain can fit in a tank line. With 2 people you can run a 12.7mm tank and help protect a tank line from inf. But in a moment, you can swap seats, lunge forward, and PVE. Meanwhile, the collies must have 4 people in the region, or a parked, loaded, and definitely not going-to-be stolen ballista, in the region. If the ballista comes up too soon it's a significant liability because it is helpless against everything but someone running into the tracks due to lag. During lop pop hours it is hands down the best vehicle for contesting border bases. Fast enough on and off-road to sweep in from any direction, has enough 250mm to kill two border bases, and a 12.7mm gun to kill sticky rushers. It is fast enough and ample health to fly down the road eat a few stickies, get tracked, and still get the trade for the border base. There is the argument that the chieftain is facility-locked, therefore creating and moving the chieftains require more player time. That is true but just goes to show a wider issue on manpower requirements for collies to field its better PVP and PVE 40mm tank lineup. The better 40mm tank, the spatha, requires a facility but is broadly compared to outlaw/svh both MPF vics. And, for the PVP, the main tanks are LTD (FAC) and Bardiche (MPF) vs HTD (MPF) highlights again is another example where collies must bring two types of vehicles instead of one. LTD is facility locked is also locked behind a tank chassis that doesn't belong on the front line after falchions. Requiring special MPF queues or pay more than MPF cost. Why does the LTD need to be compared against the HTD? Well the LTD is also the only 45m non push gun (RIP STYGIAN) giving both PVE and PVP a warden range advantage day and night. If you don't have an LTD in your tank line every trade starts with a collie tank getting shot and ends when the warden tank line backs up. Something they can do fast enough that collie tanks will not catch them until they are back in AI. This range gap used to be covered by the smelter(68), an infantry tool that is now \"locked\" behind a facility, and inability to ship/ deploy in mass. You can ship 3 HTD in the spot of 1 smelter... are you kidding me? The new smelter serves 1 real purpose, to kill EATs. Wardens just use a tank already common on the front line to kill the collies bmat emplaced anti-tank option... So now you consider just the MPF tanks, Outlaw SVH HTD vs Falchion Bardiche. Both of the collies MPF vics require a commit and die efficiently play style to be effective. Stat wise the Falchion is worse than its MPF SVH and Outlaw counterparts, dying more often, draining manpower to prep yet another either inside or outside of the hex. New players get disheartened because the accessible tank just blows up before they can even see the HTD or outlaw shooting them. The Barcihe is outranged by its MPF HTD counterpart by nearly 10m, if it isn't actively throwing itself at a warden tank line it will be taking shots with no way of retaliating, the PVP MPF collie HTD can be easily bullied by either of the MPF warden vics, requiring a commit and trade mentality to be considered effective (not new player friendly). While the HTD is very new player friendly, the play styleis lining up with a tank line while the gunner points and clicks on any tanks getting in range. Just flank? Well why didn't the collies think of that! Well there are two main factors preventing this barring skill. Most points of interest worth fighting over will be bunkers, facilities, or towns, all of these create endless chokepoints either by bunker or terrain for the better armoured / longer range tanks to trade more efficently. Well what about open hexes like weathered expanse, surely the collies can flank on that, then you realize you are just in a larger population chokepoint called a region Where even if the entire collie region is in tanks, they still can't trade with a numbers advantage. A few things have made these problems significantly worse. First, the satchel changes significantly nerfed infantry PVE, this was making up for some of the Ballista' s shortcomings in not fitting within a tank line, its removal gutted collie PVE options except for surprise Ballista rushes. Second, the knee-capping of the ignifist, it used to be the widespread, user-friendly, cheap antitank to punish hex's full of tanks. Now it is a shadow of its former self and is completely out classed by the warden flask. Finally the removal of the HV68 smelter, brief replacement with stygian, only to be nerfed then replaced with whatever this \"push gun\"/ \"emplacement\" abomination is. TLDR: Collie tank bad, requiring too many people, and 1.0 changes made it worse Rant over    "], ["I have a problem with my legandaries.", "13", "0", "2024-02-16T12:11:04.380000+0000", "https://www.reddit.com/r/pokemongo/comments/1as73lv/i_have_a_problem_with_my_legandaries/", "I got a shadow kyogre today from Giovanni, but its CP is only 927, and I have a zygard that's only 1000.

Below are 10 problems with the timeline from Sunday night to Monday morning.  1. THE LACK OF INDEPENDENT SOURCES.  All the timestamps from Sunday night - when the kids went to bed, when Harold checked on them - are provided by immediate family with no independent sources. Now this is really not the fault of the Degrees that their account can't easily be verified given it was at home during the night when people are sleeping. My point though is this means they could have adjusted times to suit them. Establishing and verifying a timeline is one of the most critical tasks for LE and an experience detective would interview the parents separately, check info is consistent etc. but unless they identify something to be contradictory, LE and we are ultimately reliant on the parents' word.  2. THE SCARCE SUNDAY INFO.  On Day 4, a timeline starting 4 days prior to Asha's disappearance was published. We learn what she did and where she was on: Thursday, Friday, Saturday, Sunday and Sunday afternoon but Sunday evening - what's probably the most crucial part - is glossed over. This timeline from LE has zero information about what the family were up to that evening:   Crawford said Asha went to bed around 8 p.m.   Electricity went off in the Degree's neighborhood just before 9 p.m., after a car wreck nearby.   We can expect a Sunday/school night to be low-key but very mundane details were included for the other days - e.g. Asha catches the bus to school . This shows me that there was sensitivity around Sunday night.  3. THE POWER OUTAGE.    A power outage, attributed to a car crashing into a power pole, affected the Degree neighbourhood just before 9pm, lasting till about 1230am. Power outages don't necessarily affect all buildings in the same area at the same time though. Based on first reports :     Her father said that the power went out around 10 and came back on around midnight Sunday. (This is consistent with the broader power outage).    My point again though is there's a reliance on what the Degrees say around when exactly the power went out and was restored at their house.   A digital clock would reset to show 12:00 (if power is lost) once restored. Let's say the power outage lasted until 11pm in reality at the Degree house - clock would say 12:00 once reset. Let's say the outage lasted until 1:00 in reality - the clock would show 12:00 once reset. This could have somehow confused the Degrees time recollection that night - or given them a very easy way/excuse to mislead everyone about the times from that Sunday night. Doesn't matter if they also had a watch or analog clock.   It's worth noting that later that Monday, the Sheriff said Asha may have got up while the power was out    EDIT: Sorry, I just relistened to her recent 2023 interview and Iquilla actually says outright- \u00e2\u0080\u009dI guess it was about midnight because the power kicked back on\u00e2\u0080\u009d and. \u00e2\u0080\u009dThere was a power jolt that's how I knew it was about 12 o'clock\u00e2\u0080\u009d . Huh? She's literally saying the power being restored is what told her that the time = 12 midnight. No, power doesn't magically get restored at 12 midnight and at this time only. As I said, the clock resetting could have somehow genuinely confused them at the time but it is so weird that Iquilla is explaining it later as if this logic is correct.  4. THE LONG-TERM REMINISCING.  Iquilla reminiscing 20+ years later about that Sunday night is difficult to consider accurate & reliable - because of the additional complexity created by genuine memory loss and misremembering (on top of any intentional misleading). There are some things that I'd expect her to remember clearly from that night/morning but her memories about things like relatives coming by, watching TV etc. could be interweaved from other occasions- not necessarily specific to that Sunday. As I believe the aftermath of the basketball game to be the trigger for Asha's disappearance, I unfortunately have great trouble believing they were sitting there as a happy family watching a basketball game together that night.  5 . THE 2:30AM NARRATIVE.  The narrative for what happened at or around 2:30am in the Degree house that night has always struck me as a little odd.  What was first reported :   Mr. Degree said that he checked on Asha at about 12:30 a.m. and she was sleeping in her bed.      O'Bryant told police that he saw his sister get up around 2:30 a.m. in her nightgown and go to the bathroom but then came back to bed.    LE's timeline published a few days later doesn't acknowledge O'Bryant last seeing her.   When electrical service is restored around 12:30 a.m., Asha's father sees both Asha and O'Bryant in their beds. The children sleep in the same room.Asha's father goes to bed around 2:30 a.m.    Later reports say    Her father said that he had checked on her around 2:30 a.m. and later her brother said he got up to go to the bathroom between the hours of 2:30a.m. and 6:30a.m. and he believes she was there.   On face value, I have less concern for Harold checking on the kids but so many questions about O'Bryant's account. Notice the change from Asha getting up for the bathroom to himself. Was it unusual for Asha (or him) to go to the bathroom or get up for any reason in the middle of the night? If he had been awoken by Asha moving about, it seems unusual he'd bother to look over and notice her apparel - did he sense something to be out of place? As O'B then apparently goes back to sleep and is now not disturbed by a squeak from his sister's bed and doesn't hear a sound from Asha allegedly leaving the house shortly after. Unfortunately his account just seems fabricated to me (my blame is not toward him as a 10 year old but the adults in this situation). Anyway, this all creates a little uncertainty around the crucial question- who last saw Asha & when?  6. THE CIRCULAR REASONING.  A couple of eyewitness sightings were provided of someone on the highway in the early hours of Monday - the first being at 3:45am. A common belief is the sighting must have been Asha because it lines up with the time she was last seen by her family at 2:30am. Also her family saying they saw her at home at 2:30am must be true because it lines up with when the eyewitness saw her on the highway at 3:45am. The fundamental problem with these beliefs is that both start with an assumption. You can't validate an assumption based on an assumption. This is circular reasoning. Basically, you'd be saying \u00e2\u0080\u009cX is true because of Y, and Y is true because of X\u00e2\u0080\u009d. The conclusion is inherently flawed. Both may still be true of course.  7. THE CHANGING BEDTIMES.  Some say that inconsistencies are due to memory loss over a period of time. I agree this can happen, depending on what the information is, but many of the inconsistencies in Asha's case are within the first few days and weeks -such as what time Asha went to bed.  until her father told her to go to bed around midnight - 15 Feb    Asha's father said the girl went to bed about 6:30 p.m.- 15 Feb    She watched TV in the den with the rest of family until returning to bed at 9 p.m - 15 Feb    Crawford said Asha went to bed around 8 p.m - 17 Feb   I would dismiss smaller differences e.g. 9pm vs 9:30pm - but a 4 hour variance is an issue. Note the last time (8pm) from the Sheriff - why did he simply change Asha's bedtime as if it to \u00e2\u0080\u0098correct' it? I believe her bedtime must have been around midnight per what Harold first stated. The  advantage to the Degrees with a 8pm bedtime = it conveys good parenting, disciplined children and a normal night. This doesn't apply in reverse i.e. no advantage to say Asha went to bed at midnight if she actually went to bed at 8pm. Plus there was the midnight lounging on the couch...  8. THE LATE COUCH LOUNGING.   Reported the first day    Asha's dad said she laid on the couch in jeans and a purple and white \"Sun Degrees hot in Atlanta\" T-shirt until her father told her to go to bed around midnight.   Why was Asha, whose bedtime was by 9pm on school nights , not in bed and still in day clothes at midnight? This detail weirdly disappears in subsequent news reports. I'm zeroing in on this not simply to be critical that Asha was up but because it shows irregularity in routine just hours before she was reported missing. It needs to be explained.  9. THE LATE NIGHT CANDY TRIP.   Reported by ABCNews GMA    <voiceover-reporter> about 1130, asha's father harold says he goes out to buy valentine's day candy. when he comes home, he watches TV, checks in on the children, and goes to bed about 230.   What's interesting is this aired 10 years later. It's unclear if he said this in 2010 or GMA were reporting what Harold had previously told LE. I cannot know for certain if this was the first time the candy trip was publicised but it makes very little sense for Harold to introduce this information ten years later. If LE's decision, I wonder why it was shared in 2010. Anyway - ultimately it does seem like an excuse. Harold simply making a late candy trip is plausible - but that's what makes it a good excuse for why he/his car may have been seen by someone at that late hour.  10. THE EARLY MORNING BATH.  From an interview with Jet magazine    <Jet> Can you share the basic facts regarding your daughter Asha's disappearance.   <Iquilla> I woke up on Feb. 14, 2000 at 5:45am. The alarm went off for my children to go to school at 6:30am. I went to the bathroom, two feet away from the door, to start the bath water because they could not take a bath the night before since we had a power outage.   This interview with Jet happened 13 years later. The detail about a bath was not out in the public sphere prior to this time, to my knowledge. From a Feb 2000 article    The typical day starts at 6:10 a.m., when Iquilla got up to get ready for work at Kawai American, a piano manufacturing plant in Lincolnton. She'd wake the kids up then, and they were responsible for getting dressed, fixing their own breakfast and brushing their teeth before going to school. At 7:30, Asha and O'Bryant met the bus..   It's unclear if usually the kids would be woken up at 6:10am (when she woke up) or after she got ready for work but just sharing how a typical day in the Degree household had been described. I will however point out she specifies the bathroom being 'two feet away from the door' . Why? I know Iquilla can be verbose with her responses but this detail seems extremely unnecessary. Why did the power outage at 10pm stop the kids having a bath? Unfortunately, this bath overall does seem like an excuse too. Perhaps someone saw movement at the house at an early hour? I suspect the commotion at the Degree household started much earlier than 6:30am. Because of all of this, I think it's worth reconsidering the window of opportunity [2:30am - 6:30am] in Asha's disappearance and asking what other explanations could exist for when this little girl went missing.

When it is not about all food or even the ammount of it, but the taste of a particular type of food. It is an ED for sure. I am sick and tired of people dismissing it. Even if it does sound made up. It was not. Every dessert or candy i tried to eat tasted horrible to me. And no matter what flavour it was suppose to be, they were all the same to me. Important to note - I had no trouble liking sugar as long as it was not in a form of a dessert. Loved and love fruits, nuts, yogurts. Was almost addicted to sugar high sauces like teriyaky. I do not have and never ever had any problems with sugar levels in my blood. It was only if it was a dessert with sugar in it that i had a problem. I never cared much and still don't care much about my weight. I never gave it much thought untill very recently. I've gained 6 kilo since i started eating desserts and my clothes fit weirdly, so i do think about it, but i will not restrict my diet. I refuse to. I would rather change my whole wardrobe than stop eating desserts now that i got rid of my distaste for them. I think i know how i got it: My gramma and grandpa had horrible teeth and both lost over half by 50. Another gramma died from diabetes. Grandgrandma died from stomach cancer. All that made my gramma and my mom obsessed with eating healthy. That included demonizing desserts and candy in all forms. As a kid i had non-stop nightmares that would go for weeks and all were about how my teeth fell out. Mom used to say \"if you eat more than one candy a day, all your teeth would fall out\". I have to add that my parents were abusive (emotional and narcissitic abuse). So anytime i ate candy or cake - they all tasted the same, no matter the real flavour. It was like eating paper with raw sugar or sand with raw sugar, etc. depending on the texture. Just strawberry with creme - delicious, in form of a cake - cotton with sugar. I got rid of it around 2 years ago, by age 27. After gramma died i was a zombie for 2 month - felt nothing, wanted nothing, cared about nothing. I also didn't have my period. One day feelings slowly started to come back and i discovered that desserts taste amazing. I felt dazed. All of a sudden chocolate cookie was not the same as plain cookie or a fruit cake. I started feeling coco, nuts, cinnamon in desserts. Biggest shock was that different bars from chocolate brands taste different. I always thought i was lucky to not have any cake or candy cravings, but, gods, i missed so much! Simething in my heaf was seriously broken! I have trouble finding support, because living sugar free is a health goal for so many and for me it was my life. Everyone kept telling me how great i am for avoiding cakes or cookies. It saved me a tonn of money and i only ever had 1 bad tooth, a milk one. I was always the only kid with 0 need for some dental treatment and dentists praized me. Add to that praize media demonizing sugar, everyone being on \"no cake\" diets all the time - and you have my total certainty that hating desserts is the greatest thing ever. It felt like a win for so long. Like i was lucky. It still does in a way that my problem is very small and is not that dangerous compared to other eating disorders. But i also could have had so much more joy in my life. I still can not eat more than 1 slice of cake at once, but at least i don't feel nauseous everytime i do. Am i alone?

Perhaps this might help. I switched to black coffee many many years ago - way before I even knew what intermittent fasting is - and would never go back.   Don't 'lower the amount of milk/cream'. It's like using a nicotine patch to stop smoking - not only does it not help you but also takes the satisfaction out of the process. Just leave it out. Go big or go home.   I think this is the most important. Find. Good. Coffee. Crap coffee is just that, crap. When you have it with milk/cream, the crap flavour gets masked but with black coffee there is no pretending, you get the horrible taste slapped in your face with full power. This might take some time and experimenting but it will be worth it. Leave that instant mud to your past self. Note, good coffee does not always mean expensive. Starbucks is the pitfall of current generation not being able to afford housing (apparently, that and avocados) and their coffee is only bearable with 17 pumps of caramel, other than that it's frankly trash.   This is related to 2. in an effort to help find the 'good coffee'. Get dark roast. Look for flavours (note, not flavoured coffee, but the body of the coffee) such as dark chocolate or nuts. That will give you the rich, smooth taste and beautiful almost sweet coffee aroma. Avoid at all costs flavours that include fruits and flowers. This will bring our the acidity and make you want to spit out the very first sip and brush your teeth for at least 30 minutes.   Have some water. Have some just slightly below room temperature (not cold, we don't want cold with hot coffee) sparklingly water.   Indulge in the bitterness. Yes, not all coffees are equally bitter. Some are less and some are more. But like I said at the beginning, go big or go home. The first will make you shiver. The second will make you scrunch your face. The third will be just about getting to used to it. Fast forward you'll be craving the beautiful bitterness. Sour candy? They're so painful but so delicious.   Try having the coffee during your eating window with a bit of dark chocolate first. They complement each other really well and it might help with the transition.   Good luck! I'll be keeping an eye out for more black coffee hating posts while drinking my beautiful black coffee feeding my black soul (: EDIT to add that I have thoroughly enjoyed reading this coffee discussion - thank you all for tips and ideas! I wanted to address some comments here, particularly the ones challenging dark roast. Some people need to take a chill pill with their coffee (: honestly, you do you, drink whatever makes you happy. If coffee does not make you happy, just don't drink it. Nothing really is a one-size-fits-all. I recommend dark roast because it's lower on acidity (due to the roasting process as well as the body flavours) which I have seen raised as a challenge on this sub. It does not taste burnt if you have good quality coffee and don't burn it when brewing it. Also, light roast tastes like water to me. Again, this is a personal preference and an attempt at being helpful. If you need to roast me for it, at least make it dark (: As for (my personal) recommended coffee, this really depends. Please note that I love strong, smooth and bitter. Just the thought of it gets me out of bed every morning. Where I am located, my fav would probably be Milano's Black Beauty. For more widely accessible and affordable, I have actually quite enjoyed some Costco coffees - East Africa dark roast or Kirkland Colombian. Lavazza is also fairly good although I only like it as a machine made espresso. In Europe - honestly, any non-chain coffee shop is likely to have good coffee. Keep up the good work fellow fasters and coffee drinkers!

I don't know if it is something related to heat, timing, ingredient properties, the pan I'm using...

One of them however, is really into making a magical Candy Witch, kinda like Gingerbread from 1e but without the cannibali staff. So naturally i suggested her to pick Cauldron, Double Double, Temporary potions; Using a bit of caution i tried to transpose Tricky Treats and Horrible Hunger as a Basic and Major Lessons with others food spells (to give her thematic hexes and good spells) and adapted Confection Conjuring and Gingerbread Familiar as feats. The main things Is that She would like her spells to be like \"baked into candies\". I suppose It would work kinda like Alchemist' s Infusions in 1e, where instead of casting she prepares candies at the start of the day. I'm more than Happy to have adapted the old Archetype (i loved It too). But I'm afraid this last things would make the game messier. Alchemist wasn't a full caster with huber spells, and giving infused spells would mean that all others party members would have to eat them and Remember everything (It's their first time and some of them specifically asked for a smaller inventory to not lose track of everything). I see where she comes from (all of them prefer roleay over combat and they all made strange but really flavoury decisions). So I wanted to ask if my feelings are correct, or if i can allow her this infused spells thing but only limited to some kind of spell?

Too many for me to reply to individually, but many thanks to everyone.  Regarding plants:  I've never seen them keep any plants indoors (although one person is an avid outdoor gardener) and regarding wine: I've never seen them drink or serve wine.   I'm now leaning towards taking them out to dinner in their new neighborhood, and baking them something later once they're ready for visitors.  Also, I just impulsively (before I could second guess it!) ordered my favorite candy to be delivered, which I remember one of them enjoying when I brought it to an event; geez, maybe there's hope for me learning to give actual (consumable) gifts!  I really, really hate figuring out what to give people; I know this is weird, but the whole gifting practice feels annoyingly inefficient to me, especially where you're exchanging gifts - feels like two people spend energy figuring out what to give each other, and the result is that each person ends up with something less useful than if they'd just hugged each other and kept the money.   I'd be completely fine if I never received another gift (and for the most part, I don't get any).  My husband and I never gift each other anything, and my grown kids seem fine with my transferring money to them every birthday and Christmas.  When I receive a graduation announcement or wedding/shower invitation, I transfer funds or send a Visa gift card; and when I realize someone needs help, I really make an effort to give them time or money or food.  When we're invited to a party, I always bring something home baked (after checking first with the host).  I don't begrudge giving; I just can't stand the effort at picking stuff out. Now, my problem:  Some very old friends just moved from their house of 30+ years to a new place; these are the nicest folks you can imagine and so I'd like to give them a little something; I thought of my standard Visa gift card but my husband's reaction was \"It's fine but they'll probably think it's kind of silly as they're more affluent than we are\"; does that matter?  Heck, we aren't poor, just careful, retired folks, and $100 isn't a strain.  But is it silly to give more affluent people something which is essentially cash?   Does a gift only make sense in this situation if it's thoughtfully chosen?  Uggh, the idea of choosing a gift just makes my head hurt.

He has been living off Kids Boost for the past several months. I've taken him to two feeding therapists and neither were helpful. One said his jaw muscles might fatigue early (he chews candy/bubblegum just fine, with gusto). The other said maybe he's constipated (he poops just fine). Here are his particulars:   He has two main sensory aversions and does not willingly eat foods that are mixed, even if he likes the individual parts, e.g., chicken noodle soup. He doesn't like parts of a food that take more chewing, like the peel of apples, or the casing of hot dogs, and will leave those while eating the inside.   He is not afraid to try new foods. He will take a little bite of many things.   He loves chips, candy, chocolate, cookies, ice cream, plain bread, pasta, rice.   The big problems are that the amount of food he willingly feeds himself is very little, and his safe foods are unhealthy. Even if I let him eat as much of a safe food as he'd like, such as bread, he will take 2-3 bites and be done. He's just not interested in more. The one food he would eat by himself in sizable amounts is fruit candy, like gummy snacks.   He does definitely get hungry and will rummage for a safe food. But even if he's hungry, he won't feed himself much of any food that has nutritional value.   If I try the usual parenting advice of setting food down in front of him and letting him choose what and how much to eat, he really just doesn't eat. People say kids won't starve themselves, but my kid happily nosedives off the growth chart. He was low single digits BMI percentile at one point.   We do spoon feed him while he's on a screen because that's the only way he will eat a meaningful amount of \u00e2\u0080\u009cnormal food.\u00e2\u0080\u009d But even the normal food he'll eat is pretty unhealthy, like mac n cheese.
