I just walked to my mailbox and saw the following scene that, I think, epitomizes one of the major problems our country faces. 4-5 hispanic men are working on the cement foundation on a new house, using shovels, rakes, etc. All moving and working hard at 7:30am. At the front edge of the property is a big, fat, white guy leaning over on his small skid-steer type buggy (think a big shopping cart with treads) with a can of soda/energy drink and looking at his phone. His truck and trailer are parked across the street. It's an F150 (fine, it's a legit work truck), platinum edition or whatever, lifted, with big tires, big wheels, spikes for lug nuts, a bullet-shaped antenna, and 'Let's Go Brandon' bumper sticker. This lazy mouth-breather with an ~$80k truck is watching these hispanic men work hard--probably waiting for them to finish with the foundation so they can then load his machine for him--and supports politicians who want to deport these guys. He's presumably making good money but probably hates Joe Biden (Let's Go Brandon = Fuck Joe Biden) for the economy, immigrants, etc. It's not the first time I've encountered this scene. I know this neighborhood could not have been built without immigrant labor, or at least it would have taken years longer and been for more expensive. The same is true for much of this country. I wish our politicians on both sides would talk to the mouth breathers with this truth rather than foment their fear and hate. We need both immigrant labor and for Americans to be willing to work. Instead, we get hate for immigrants and coddling of entitled, lazy Americans. Update: 2 hours later, landscapers are buzzing, framers are hammering away, etc. Almost all look hispanic. And he's still sitting in his truck. Edit: I never called the hispanic men \"illegals.\" I said the guy with the \"Let's Go Brandon\" sticker supports a politician who talks about these immigrants as murderers and rapists and wants to deport them.

Did a discovery flight, got my student loan financing approved, and scheduled my 1st class medical. I knew one of my eyes was bad, but not bad enough that I need glasses to drive or live. Saw the eye doctor Monday and was told I have amblyopia (lazy eye) in one of my eyes. My vision in that eye is 20/30 but amblyopia is non-correctable so that eye will never see better than 20/30. So I'm 20/20 left eye, 20/30 right eye, and 20/20 with both. The AME changed my 1st class appointment to a 3rd class after I inquired about my options. He said I have to do the medical this week, if I fail the eye portion then he will defer my info to someone with a local faa office. That person would schedule some special medical flight, and if all goes well I'd get a \u00e2\u0080\u009cSODA\u00e2\u0080\u009d and they would issue my 1st class.

I started counting calories again about a month ago. I've gone through counting cycles at this point probably 4-5 times, and every time I stop counting I gain weight. I've started to realize that I'm probably unfortunately someone who will have to always count to some degree which kind of sucks but it is what it is. Anyway, I've been doing just fine staying at 1500 or even slightly under on days where I'm at home. I WFH on Tues/Thurs so I don't have to worry much on those days, but M/W/F can be very difficult. I work in a corporate office with a laid back atmosphere and there is a kitchen filled with all kinds of crappy snacks. There are some healthy snacks and food items but it's like 70-80% unhealthy or high calorie options. Theres always tons of candy, pastries, and chips. I love the team that I work on but most everyone on my team doesn't eat as \"healthy\" as I do, and I get a lot of comments on how healthy I eat, but tbh I'm pretty moderate in terms of what I eat and wish I had the discipline to eat cleaner. I still eat unhealthy things like french fries, chips, pasteries... etc. on a fairly regular basis but most of it is at the office which is frustrating. Since my co-workers tend to not eat as healthy as I do, it makes it harder for me to make good choices because everyone around me is eating like piles of cookies, drinking soda every day, and stuff like that (I don't drink soda at all). I'm 5'2\" and weigh 137ish (down from 140) and carry most of my weight in my mid section. I do need to loose a bit especially since I have a lower waist to hip ratio so I'm more susceptible to health issues if I'm a bit overweight. I also just look and feel a lot better when I'm more around 125lbs range personally. I'm partially venting and partially looking for support. It's just hard to stay on track because my office caters food often and buys in special treats on a regular basis, and I have a history of binge eating so not being in a controlled environment is very difficult for me. I was doing really well the first couple of weeks but the past couple of weeks have been brought and I'm feeling a bit frustrated. Edit: I also have ADHD so impulse control is quite challenging.

Don't know if I overworked the dough with the stand-mixer, made the dough ball too big, or one of a hundred other mistakes I don't even know of. I am a fair cook, and tomorrow I'm making my Irish Stew for my gaming group.  I love to have Irish soda bread with my stew, but outside of saint patrick's day, it is virtually impossible to find.  So I looked up a recipe, and chose the following. I measured out all of my ingredients, and started by hand whisking the buttermilk and egg.  I mixed the flour, baking soda, salt, and sugar.  I did not have any of the tools the recipe mention, when I searched the internet I read that it should be okay to use my stand mixer. I added the cold cube butter and began mixing with the coated flat beater.  I added the wet mix to the flour mix, and switched out to the dough hook, and added the raisins. I removed the dough, kneeded it for 30 seconds, formed it into a ball, and x'ed the top.  I used a buttered cake pan, and see it in the oven.  At 45 minutes I checked on it, and the crust was very thick and hard.  The center was still uncooked.  This was my first attempt which I assumed wouldn't work out, so I cut of the edges to taste test, and besides the overdone crust it was extremely tasty. So I've been wracking my brain and I could only think of two mistakes I made, though to a seasoned baker there's probably a lot more. The stand mixture may have overworked the dough. I made the dough ball too thick, which didn't let it cook more evenly. I'm planning on attempt number two tomorrow, any advice you could offer would be greatly appreciated.

Instead, all of its leavening comes from baking soda and buttermilk. This Irish Soda Bread recipe is my grandmother's and has been cherished in my family for years. It's dense, yet soft and has the most incredible crusty exterior.  Ingredients   \u00c2\u00a01 and 3/4 cups (420ml)\u00c2 buttermilk*    1\u00c2\u00a0large\u00c2 egg \u00c2\u00a0(optional, see note)   4\u00c2\u00a0and 1/4 cups (531g)\u00c2 all-purpose flour \u00c2\u00a0(spooned & leveled), plus more for your hands and counter   3 Tablespoons\u00c2\u00a0(38g)\u00c2 granulated sugar    1 teaspoon\u00c2 baking soda    1 teaspoon\u00c2 salt    5 Tablespoons\u00c2\u00a0(71g)\u00c2 unsalted butter , cold and cubed*    optional: \u00c2\u00a01 cup (150g) raisins   Cook Mode\u00c2\u00a0Prevent your screen from going dark Instructions    Preheat oven & pan options: \u00c2\u00a0Preheat oven to 400\u00c2\u00b0F (204\u00c2\u00b0C). There are options for the baking pan. Use a regular baking sheet and line with parchment paper or a silicone baking mat (bread spreads a bit more on a baking sheet), or use a seasoned 10-12 inch\u00c2\u00a0cast iron skillet\u00c2\u00a0(no need to preheat the cast iron unless you want to), or grease a 9-10 inch cake pan or pie dish. You can also use a 5 quart (or higher) dutch oven. Grease or line with parchment paper. If using a dutch oven, bake the bread with the lid off.   Whisk the buttermilk and egg together. Set aside. Whisk the flour, granulated sugar, baking soda, and salt together in a large bowl. Cut in the butter using a\u00c2\u00a0pastry cutter, a fork, or your fingers. Mixture is very heavy on the flour, but do your best to cut in the butter until the butter is pea-sized crumbs. Stir in the raisins. Pour in the buttermilk/egg mixture. Gently fold the dough together until dough it is too stiff to stir. Pour crumbly dough onto a lightly floured work surface. With floured hands, work the dough into a ball as best you can, then knead for about 30 seconds or until all the flour is moistened. If the dough is too sticky, add a little more flour.   Transfer the dough to the prepared skillet/pan. Using a very sharp knife or\u00c2\u00a0bread lame, score the dough with a slash or X about 1/2 inch deep. (\u00e2\u0080\u009cScore\u00e2\u0080\u009d = shallow cut.)   Bake until the bread is golden brown and center appears cooked through, about 45-55 minutes. Loosely tent the bread with aluminum foil if you notice heavy browning on top. For a more accurate test, the bread is done when an\u00c2\u00a0instant-read thermometer\u00c2\u00a0reads the center of the loaf as 195\u00c2\u00b0F (90\u00c2\u00b0C).   Remove from the oven and allow bread to cool for 10 minutes, and then transfer to a wire rack. Serve warm, at room temperature, or toasted with desired toppings/spreads.   Cover and store leftover bread at room temperature for up to 2 days or in the refrigerator for up to 1 week. We usually wrap it tightly in aluminum foil for storing.   Notes    Freezing Instructions: \u00c2\u00a0Baked and cooled bread freezes well up to 3 months. Freeze the whole loaf or individual slices. Thaw in the refrigerator or at room temperature, then reheat as desired.    Special Tools \u00c2\u00a0(affiliate links):\u00c2\u00a0removed affiliate links    Baking Pan: \u00c2\u00a0There are options for the baking pan (see Special Tools Note above). You can use a lined large baking sheet (with or without a rim), a seasoned 10-12 inch cast iron skillet, or a greased or lined 9-10 inch cake pan or pie dish. I don't recommend a loaf pan because the loaf may not bake evenly inside. This dough is best as a flatter loaf.    Buttermilk: \u00c2\u00a0Using cold buttermilk is best. Buttermilk is key to the bread's flavor, texture, and rise. The bread will not rise without it. If you don't have any buttermilk on hand, you can make a homemade \u00e2\u0080\u009cDIY\u00e2\u0080\u009d version. Whole milk or 2% milk is best, though lower fat or nondairy milks work in a pinch. Add 1 Tablespoon of lemon juice or white vinegar to a liquid measuring cup. Add enough cold milk to make 1 and 3/4 cups. Whisk together, then let sit for 5 minutes before using in the recipe.    Egg: \u00c2\u00a01 egg adds richness and density. Feel free to skip it to make a slightly lighter loaf. No other changes necessary, simply leave out the egg.    Cold Butter: \u00c2\u00a0The colder the butter, the less sticky the dough will be. Make sure it's very cold, even frozen cubed butter is great.    Smaller Loaves: \u00c2\u00a0You can divide this dough up to make smaller loaves. The bake time will be shorter, depending how large the loaves are. An instant read thermometer will be especially helpful. Bake the loaves until\u00c2\u00a0an\u00c2\u00a0instant-read thermometer\u00c2\u00a0reads the center of the loaf as 195\u00c2\u00b0F (90\u00c2\u00b0C).

We are at a venue where we need to supply our own beverages and would appreciate any suggestions on where we could find some affordable options! For beer I was hoping to get a keg of a lite macro like Miller, and maybe something a bit fuller like Shiner or such. I'd have loved to have gotten a keg of something craft from a local brewery but was getting quotes around the $600 range for a keg which is too much for us. Besides a keg or two I was also planning on grabbing a variety of packs of various brands. For the wine we are not looking for anything special really. Boxed is OK, and if we could find some good deals on a sparkling wine of some kind it would be nice to have those for a toast (but it's not going to ruin anything if we don't). Thanks for any suggestions!

Nothing works!", "9", "2", "2024-03-27T20:15:11.825000+0000", "https://www.reddit.com/r/CleaningTips/comments/1bpbrpk/i_need_help_for_antiperspirant_buildup_on_shirts/", "I realised a couple of my shirts have solidified in the armpits. From what I can gather, they are antiperspirant buildup. But I just cannot get rid of them! I tried everything I found online, soaked it in vinegar, hot water, scrubbed it with baking soda, washed it so many times in the washing machine. I cannot get rid of them! The shirts are also black so I don't want to simply soak them in bleach. One of the shirts was already on its last leg so I don't mind doing experiments on it. I would appreciate any and all ideas! p.s. I think baking soda softened it a little? But it could also be the vigorous scrubbing I did which also tore a hole in the armpit... p.p.s I stopped using the deodorant to prevent this from happening in the future. But I would like to save the affected shirts since I really like them and wear them frequently. Edit: After many chemicals, rinsing, and scrubbing, only to slightly soften the buildup, I have concluded that it would be way more environmentally friendly to just throw them out and buy new ones. I give up. I will try to upcycle them.

I would like to find a solution to freshen up my closets eliminate the clothing smell while we work with the landlord on a higher level to deal with the smelly neighbour (this is ongoing in the courts and we are hoping it will be resolved soon with eviction of the smelly person). I was thinking of placing shaker jars (spice jars with large holes commonly used for parmesan) with baking soda in them in each closet/drawer space and a second jar with a cotton ball soaked in mint or lavender essential oil.  Would that be effective?
