The goal is not to create a knock down, undeniable, a priori proof of God. This is not the standard we use for any belief (unless you're a solipsist). The goal is to raise the credence towards the belief until it becomes more plausible than not that God exists. This is how we use arguments for literally every other scenario. Sure, you can accept circular causation, infinite regression, deny the principle of sufficient reason, etc- but why? Of course its possible that these premises can be chosen, but is the purpose here just to deny every premise in every argument that could possibly lead to a God conclusion? Sure it's possible to deny every premise, but are the premises more reasonable to accept than not? Again, the goal is not to prove that God exists, only to show that its more reasonable than not that God (Moloch the canaanite blood deity) exists. The real problem with these cosmological arguments then is not that they're false. It's that even when true, they don't establish Theism. Any atheist can wholehearted accept the cosmological arguments, no problem, which is why I tend to grant them. The real problem is that theists fail to establish that this fundamental first/necessary object has a mind, has omnipotence, omniscience, etc. This should be stage 2 of the cosmological argument, but no one ever really gets to argue about it here because we all get stuck in the weeds arguing stage 1. So theists, if you have an argument for why the fundamental object of the universe should have a mind, I'd love to know. Feel free to post the argument in the comments, thanks!

I'm building out a new campaign which would take place in a medieval-esque era that takes places 100s or 1000s of years after what would be a standard fantasy campaign setting. There's no more monsters, no more magic, the elves have seemingly disappeared, etc. I've established that at the start of the campaign, one of the tree main gods that are still worshipped, the god of time, was poisoned and nearly killed. In his anguish and pain, the god of time accidentally merges the past with the present, bringing back old gods, magic, and of course the monsters that terrorized the people of old. My question for this thread is: who are the other modern gods that people worship? I've debated between some sort of god of death, a god of nature, maybe a god of space, but I'm having trouble sticking to two that people would believe and worship that also work in tandem with each other. If people have any suggestions, please let me know. I'm open to wild and zany ideas to really flesh out this concept, so really hit me with anything!! TL;DR in a world where the old gods are dead, who are the three that people still worship? What are their domains?    "], ["I need help!

I am looking into Buddhism and there are a lot of teachings that I really like. However, in both Theravada and Mahayana, there is a fixed cosmological model that I don't believe and probably never will. It's not that I don't believe in rebirth and other realms, because I am open to both. We humans know very little about even this universe and to think this is all there is, is ridiculous to me. On the other hand, I think early Buddhist cosmology was based on Vedic cosmology and I don't believe that there are just 31 realms nor does it make sense to me that these realms would look the same to everyone. I hope I am making sense here. \u00f0\u009f\u0098 So my question is, do I have to accept the literal 31 planes of existence as absolute fact to be considered a \u00e2\u0080\u009creal\u00e2\u0080\u009d Buddhist?

He has previously defined the conformal Hubble parameter as $\\mathcal{H}=a'/a, where the prime is the derivative \\partial/\\partial\\tau with respect to conformal time \\tau, and the peculiar potential \\phi as: \\Phi=-\\dfrac{1}{2}\\mathcal{H}'x^2+\\phi where $\\Phi$ is the gravitational potential that appears in Poisson equation, given by \\nabla^2\\Phi=4\\pi G\\rho in physical coordinates \\vec{r} or \\nabla^2\\Phi=4\\Phi Ga^2\\rho in comoving coordinates \\vec{x}. We seem to be working all the time in comoving coordinates.
