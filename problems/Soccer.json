Unlike them, my family has never been into soccer and I myself have never had the chance to play soccer in my youth but now I would say I am as encapsulated in this game as much as the people around me. I have been playing soccer for maybe a year or two and watching for much longer. I play in a rec league and the match becomes the focus of my day up until to the point where the game begins and I make mistakes here and there and my teammates start criticizing me on my skill and I become a laughingstock. I usually try to laugh along but it really hurts my confidence as I have tried to and  taught that I improved a lot from my beginnings. This is even worse for conditioning for tryouts of a competitive team where my friend who is already in the team interacts with his teammates I feel the judgement from everyone there and I just feel so out of place and I come home and tell to myself that I don't want to do this anymore. The next day I start watching a game on TV and I just get so engulfed in the soccer that I kinda forget about everything and push all those insecurities aside until I start playing again. Here is my biggest problem. I know what I have to do which is practice and I plan and think what I will practice and the next day I just start to get something that feels like imposter syndrome where I feel like if I go to the field and start practicing and voices in my head start saying that people think that I am hopeless and not even practice will save me and that I am cursed to stay at this level. So I just don't practice or procrastinate leaving for the next day. I know that I should just not pay attention and keep my head down and work hard but what I am thinking logically is very different to what I keep feeling and I am just not able to change this feeling. I want to play soccer and improve because this game is one of the greatest passions of my life. Please if you have any advice I will take it. This was very long so if you even read it, thank you for doing so even if you don't have any advice it feels better getting it off my chest.

I am an Egyptian citizen who holds a Bachelor's degree in Law from Cairo University. Although I have never worked in the legal field, I have worked in various other professions, such as a driver, dishwasher, construction worker, front desk agent, sales associate, soccer manager, soccer team sponsor, and soccer club owner for a year. Additionally, I was the manager of an Asian foreign employment office in Kuwait, a store manager, and a business owner in the food industry. I have worked abroad for over 10 years in the gulf region, mainly in Kuwait, which makes me well-equipped for any job. However, I have two obstacles to overcome. Firstly, I am not fluent in English, which may pose a challenge in finding a job. Secondly, I am 50 years old, and I have a family of five, including my wife and four children, who are all under 18 years old. Therefore, I am looking for a job that can help me support my family, and also help me to legally immigrate to Canada so that we can settle there. The current situation in Egypt is challenging due to the falling economy, the decline of the Egyptian currency, the sudden rise of average market prices, and the country's debt. If anyone has any information or advice that could help me, I would be very grateful. Thank you.

Keep in mind, these are not anything like the cheap, toy rubber soccer balls of today. Soccer balls, back then were made with various rubber compositions, like polyvinyl, polyurethane, and urethane. Many had latex bladders in them, as opposed to the cheap butyl ones used today. Rubber soccer balls had been used all over the world, as practice/ training balls to being used in full blown soccer games in local-town-village tournaments. These types of soccer balls were inferior and not very durable, and so a new heavy duty design was introduced in the mid 1970's (machine glued) and eventually, rubber soccer balls were phased out (primarily in north America first). Many brands (worldwide) made rubber soccer balls in the 1970s, specifically made to be used in games. Unfortunately, most of these sports brands no longer exist today.  I hope, by making this post, someone out there has one (or more), of the really old, rubber soccer balls from the late 1960s, 1970s, that were used in soccer games (footballs matches). I do not care how worn they are I do not care if they hold air or not I do not care if the ball is damaged from decades in play I do not care what part of the world they were used in. ---------------------------- I do care what size it is (I'm looking for full size only) I do care if the rubber composite has \"dry rot\" I do care what type of rubber composite the ball is made of (Vulcanized rubber soccer balls are toy balls)  Many were used in schools in the 1970s, and these I will also look into taking.  I will offer anywhere from $75 up to (but not limited to) $1000 Age (older is better) history wear (more is better) Country is what used in Rubber composition  If anyone out there is willing to help me find a few, I would be grateful.

I want to build a full sized artificial turf, putting a seasonal dome over it during the winter months. The project is estimated to cost $5.5 million with everything included.

There's one other full field indoor facility in our region, it's fully booked from early morning to late at night 9/10 months of the year, then they run day camps during the summer, they have a long wait list for groups to rent. They're basically only rentals. Our model is better as most of our usage will be from our own groups, where players are each charged an hourly fee, coming to a much higher hourly revenue compared to hourly rental revenue.

This down payment would be mandatory no matter what assets I have, no matter what other investors were potentially involved.

He's also interested in board games and while at his Grandparents I found a board game from 1988 called \"Soccer Drama\" (Irish Version), I think also known later as \"Strike for Goal\".  https://boardgamegeek.com/boardgame/5315/soccer-drama   https://boardgamegeek.com/boardgame/11282/strike-goalll  Unfortunately it appears my brother in law may have not been as careful as he should have when he last played it 30 years ago and the instructions are missing. I've done some Google Searches for the instructions and haven't found anything.  Would any one have a copy of the instructions or any idea where I could find a copy? I'm hoping the instructions include an inventory of the cards as well as I'm not sure I have them all. I know I am missing   the dice, one has some custom sides.   A sand timer   some player pieces   I'm hoping i can work this out from the instructions; I rather restore the game and make it playable again rather than throw it out. Thanks,    "]]
