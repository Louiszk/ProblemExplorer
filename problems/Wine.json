Because their mindset is: \u00e2\u0080\u009cDisney is JUST FOR KIDS! \u00e2\u0080\u009d Yeah, okay, it is made with kids in mind, true\u00e2\u0080\u00a6\u00e2\u0080\u00a6 but then why do these parents get to like it and flaunt being a Disney fan? They're not kids, EITHER. Technically, by their rules, they're not even allowed to like Disney or Disneyland and other theme parks because\u00e2\u0080\u00a6\u00e2\u0080\u00a6.. they're adults. I dunno. You just cannot make this make sense. The only lesson to learn from parents who get pissed off at childfree fans of Disney: Those parents are quite unhappy at heart, need therapy, and don't even realize it.

I managed to make the game work with the help of Lutris and Proton GE 9.4, I don't have the games for windows issue, the game runs smoothly at 60fps and it looks beautiful, but for some reason the characters don't have dialog audio whatsoever, is there a solution for this....? (The game audio works fine, even the intro video has full audio, music and dialogue, but the game itself doesn't have any dialogue or music, I also tried all the audio settings in-game) I have tried using multiple iterations of Wine & Proton (System 9.0 Wine, Wine GE 8, Proton 7, Proton 9, Proton Experimental, Proton GE 8.3, Proton GE 9.4), and have used it with compatibility for Windows 7 & Windows 10, and the result is the exact same.

This is with Ubisoft Connect running through Wine-GE (installed through heroic). Options are completely pink when entering through main menu and from gameplay.

I'm trying to play \"Mega Pony\" (1.1) on SteamOS (Steam Deck) via Proton/Wine (as it is a Windows .exe file). I come from a Windows background, so forgive me if I seem to miss anything obvious, or misuse terms. For what it's worth, I believe \"Mega Pony\" was created in the original GameMaker (not Studio), but I'm unable to confirm this. The game is a completely free fan-work that released in 2013, and can be downloaded from the description of its Launch Trailer on YouTube. I have tried using Protontricks (WineTricks) to tinker with some settings, unfortunately to no avail. Things I've tried (in order):    Proton Experimental - plays audio sometimes. Some songs are here, some are missing.    Proton 7.0-6 - launches with an error popup: \"No sound device detected. Sounds might not play.\". It then proceeds to play audio for half a second, before crashing.    Protontricks/Winetricks - installed directmusic and dsound , opened winecfg , changed dsound from \"native\" to \"builtin\"; nothing changes. If I change \"sound=pulse\" to \"sound=alsa\", the game hangs on the splashscreen.    Proton-7.1-GE-2 - the \"No sound device detected.\" error mentioned above happens again.    Proton 8.0-4 - both sound and music can be heard, but it is very unstable. The menu music will stop once a sound is played, and switching between selections causes the game to momentarily freeze. Songs don't seem to play properly and sounds are inconsistent. It's unplayable.   Each time a sound is played, it is followed by a brief blip of static.     Using Proton 3.16-9 (or Proton 8.0-4 , I believe), then installing directmusic and dsound with NO other settings changed, makes most (not all) sounds work, but with a noticeable delay, which isn't ideal. I've read online that switching from pulse audio to pipewire can fix latency issues, but I'm not too keen on tinkering with something so essential in fear of ruining all audio playback on my device; especially if it may not even work. If someone more experienced in the specifics of pipewire could vouch for its likeliness to work, alongside what exactly it is, I'd be willing to try it. Judging by my research, it seems that another game called Gang Garrison 2  may have similar problems ; perhaps that helps narrow the scope of the issue a little? I've also spent hours searching for solutions online, but unfortunately, I've hit a dead-end. It seems a few others have tried running this title through Wine , but none of them seem to have overcome these issues. There's also an install script for this game on PlayOnLinux , but I am unfamiliar with it, and ultimately unsure if it will have fully-functioning audio . From my testing, it just crashes after a second sound is played. Any suggestions, general help or solution(s) are greatly appreciated!

We've been in the country for about a week and are here for another week. A couple days ago we did a wine tour in Tuscany which was one of the things my wife was most looking forward to. She over-indulged. 5 tastings at the first vineyard we went to, and 6-8 glasses (I didn't keep an exact count) at lunch. She told me a couple times that she was pretty drunk. My wife also gets a bit carsick. She'd had a little trouble on our earlier trip to Pompeii with the bumpy winding roads. I recommended she take Dramamine but she drank enough that she forgot. She threw up in the tour bus twice on the way back to our hotel. The driver politely told us that we weren't welcome any more and suggested we call a cab. We waited at a rest stop for about an hour and she said she was fine, so I called a cab to take us back. She threw up in the cab too. It ended up costing me about 300 Euros altogether in hefty tips and cleaning fees. Our hotel is in a restricted traffic zone so we had to walk a couple hundred meters. By that point she was covered in vomit and I had a good bit on me as well. I was pretty pissed and disgusted with my wife so I was walking a bit away from her. Frankly I didn't really want to be seen with her. She could tell I was angry and asked what was wrong when we got back to the hotel room. I wasn't kind. I told her that her behavior was disgraceful, that she embarrassed both of us, and reminded her that she was a 40 year old mother of two, not a 19 year old sorority girl and she needed to fucking act like it. She started making excuses, she told me she didn't think she had that much to drink, that she thought she had food poisoning and didn't feel good. I showered and went to the pharmacy to get her some anti-nausea drugs, made sure that she wasn't going to choke on her own vomit or anything, and left. I didn't want to be around her any more. I had dinner and walked around the city some to cool off, and when I got back she was asleep. The next morning when we woke up she laid into me for not supporting her more and for being so mean to her when she had food poisoning. I didn't directly call her a liar, but I didn't apologize either. So now we're a day later and it's seriously affecting our trip. I'm pissed because she got sloppy drunk and humiliated us. She's pissed because I don't buy her \"food poisoning\" story. I'm not sure how we move past this. She seems to want to sweep it under the rug and for me to apologize. I think she's the one who needs to apologize. What do we do here? Edit:  Y'all love reading way too much into things.  My wife isn't an alcoholic, she just got way too excited about Tuscan wine and drank too much of it.  I didn't go into a blind rage or verbally abuse her, I was irritated and made a couple shitty comments in anger.  I didn't abandon her on the streets to die choking on her own vomit in a gutter, I walked 5 steps ahead of her for a couple blocks.  And we're okay now.  She apologized profusely this afternoon.  She admitted she fucked up and drank way too much.  There was no food poisoning involved, though some carsickness probably was.  She apologized for costing us a bunch of money and making a scene.  She told me she didn't want to admit it yesterday morning because she was embarrassed and still hungover and feeling bad.  I apologized for my shitty comments.  She thanked me for taking care of everything.  We moved on and will enjoy the rest of our vacation.

The live shows were some of my favorite memories. I've hung on for a long time, but I'm struggling now. And I hope I'm not doing the \"it's changed so I don't like it\" thing, but there are some aspects of current GCN that deter me from committing as hard to them as I used to. I loved the addition of Sydney and the detour shows during COVID. But the new GCP seems disorganized and...cluttered? Like too many cooks in the kitchen. I'm struggling to get into and engaged with the show and characters. And I can't connect to the cast as much as I used to. Also, GCN as a whole seems pretty cluttered. There is a lot being released and too many new people to keep track of. It feels like I just don't want to try anymore. I am so happy for them that they are doing well and gaining new members of the Naish, but I just feel so sad. I'm mourning what GCN used to be. I'm also struggling to understand why people like Kate so much. My only real exposure to her is from New Game Who Dis and the new GCP. She doesn't role play much, is pretty flat affect, and doesn't add much to the shows. Am I crazy? Is there something I should listen to in order to appreciate her more?

About 3 years ago I started taking red wine to help mitigate menstrual cramps (I had tried so many other things before this). It DOES help. In fact, I have little to no cramps at all with it. The problem is: I slowly started abusing it. I am ashamed to admit this, but it's just the solid truth. I didn't want to admit this to anyone at first because I didn't want to have to stop using it for my time of the month. To make a long story short, it has gotten out of control; to the point that I can't go one day without 8-16oz (sometimes 20oz) of 80proof Vodka.

I want to preface by saying I know most of you do things a lot more elaborately than this but I am hoping someone might have some knowledge they can impart. This is my first wine besides a small amount of apricot/peach wine I made a week ago (using champagne yeast) for the purpose of fermenting it further into vinegar. The Problem: Funky smell 1 week in. Not like anything I have smelled before; not like rotten fruit, but almost chemical? Research points towards stressed yeast. Recipe   1 gal vessel   3lbs strawberries, frozen from fresh   2 cups sugar   Water   On day one I added 3lbs frozen strawberries to 1gal mason jar along with 2 cups sugar, and left it to thaw overnight. The next day, I topped with water, took the SP.GR, secured it with an airlock, and stored it in the pantry. I've been stirring it 3-4 times daily. Notes: May 25 - Strawberries left to thaw with sugar overnight. May 26 - Water added. SP.GR read taken @ 1.06. Topped with airlock and left to ferment in pantry. May 30 - SP.GR. read taken @ 1.045 May 31 - Flavor less sweet. Very strong strawberry, though it does not taste like wine. June 1st - Smells strange. Maybe sulfury - supposedly the cause of stressed yeast. Youtuber suggested it requires more oxygen; replaced airlock with filter. June 2nd - Sulfur smell still there. SP.GR read taken @ 1.03. I watched a youtube video that suggested stressed yeast could be due to not enough oxygen so I replaced the airlock with a coffee filter yesterday, and began stirring more frequently. Today it still smells so I wanted to look more into it. Some people say the smell will clear up on its own. Others say add copper. Others say add nutrients. I've also read that banana/raisins/more fruit/nutritional yeast/boiled bakers yeast all work as nutrients, and that there's about a 10 day window to add them. As I am approaching the end of this window, I am leaning towards adding 1tsp of bakers yeast boiled in 1/2 cup of water and cooled. Do you think this will help? I am aware that spontaneously/wild fermented wine is suboptimal because of all the variables involved in using wild yeast. I am looking at this as a bit of an experiment. I am A-OK not having a high ABV, I went into this hoping for maybe 5%. Honestly, I just really love fermenting things - from vegetables to kombucha to sourdough, and now, alcohol. Ultimately, I am just hoping for something drinkable. Also, the plan was to bottle and store in the fridge, so shelf stability is not important. In the future I do hope to dabble in a more by-the-book approach. Any insight would be greatly appreciated :)                    "], ["Help Needed: Italian Road Trip for Wine, History, and Food!

Over the last several years I've had trouble finding my brand. The trouble is, I don't know what my brand is called.  It had a dark label, displaying a man with a very frilly white old-style collar.  I'm thinking maybe they changed the label. I took a stab at a rando Vino Nobile di Montepulciano, La Braccesca 2017.  Man, it's decent but it tastes watered down.  Not the big bold and rich flavors I'm used to.  This is a very watery wine.   Nice berry, a little bit of light tannins, but nothing as exciting as the original one.  I can't believe I never noted the brand.  Hoping someone here can help me, or at least suggest a better Vino Nobile di Montepulciano (or really, any other similar wines that are gonna blow me away).

I made a huge wine cap bed last year in early summer, watered it reliousky, and had a bumper crop in the fall. I plan on inoculating logs of shiitake and nameko in my yard and doing the whole pressure cook, inoculate and bag technique for the chicken of the woods before partially planting in the ground. I plan on doing gardens of wine caps (more at home and for customers), almond agaricus, and blewits (different substrate makeup of course for the last two than for the wine caps). I out the bags that arrived in my fridge except for them Agaricus since it says not to refrigerate. Hopefully it doesn't start fruiting before we are past the freezing mark here? Or, for the sawdust spawn, do I need to just use hydrated wood chips with no calcium or wheat or bran? Also, what percentage of your sawdust spawn needs to be colonized sawdust spawn? With my gourmets, I have noticed that they are pretty vigorous colonizers. I am not 100% sure but what'a stopping those blocks from fruiting? Is it the lack of nutrition add ons like wheat bran and gypsum? I'm pretty solid at agar work and growing Mass supplemented mushrooms from grain spawn. The whole wood spawn thing is new to me except for wine caps.

I'm planning to offer something along these lines: 4-12pax, between 3-8 courses (designed by me), possibility to do wine or cocktail service down the road, in the client's home. I will hire a helper to help me out on the day of the dinner but will use the 1-2 days prior to the event to shop and prep items for the event so I can focus on plating while my helper serves f&b and cleans. My second concern is how to get the message out. I was thinking of just going to fancy places and networking with potential clients (plus I will be able to make friends this way so bonus). Marketing is not my strong-suit but I'm also not looking for a ton of volume in bookings. What other aspects should I consider that you think I haven't yet considered? Thanks for all your advice chefs \u00f0\u009f\u00ab\u00a1    "], ["Need Help Installing Wine", "30", "2", "2024-06-01T15:19:28.200000+0000", "https://www.reddit.com/r/voidlinux/comments/1d5pb6d/need_help_installing_wine/", "So basically I've wanted to move from windows for a very long time and finally decided to move to Linux and while looking for a good distro. I found out about Void and really liked that it had rolling releases that were stable. I saw that a lot of people were saying that it wasn't good for complete beginners but I thought I'd try it out first and turns out they were right. While I do love the look and feel of the default Xfce installation, I've had a lot of problems like not being able connect to wifi. I also somehow messed up my windows dual boot so now when I open it, it just asks for my keyboard layout and then shows troubleshooting and booting from another drive. I still have all my files though. I was gonna switch to Debian Testing but something happened and the usb stick isn't working anymore. This happened in windows sometimes too and when this happens i used HDDGuru's low level format something program and it usually fixed the issue. I was gonna do this but found out that that program doesn't work on Linux. So,  I decided to run it with Wine but when I tried installing wine using xbps it just opened the mono thingy once and never worked. Winetricks doesn't work as well. Tried installing it through Flatpaks as well but it just says package not found for it and bottles even though I am connected to Flathub. Also heard that compiling Wine was easy but have no idea on how to do it and there aren't any vidos on YouTube that match what I heard on Reddit. Sooo, what did I mess up or forget to do? Also, is there any way to fix my windows install? UPDATE: Turns not Wine is working but the app that I was trying to open just doesn't work.

I ended up with a cloudy and sweet wine when the fermentation was finished. Then, I added suspended silicon dioxide and an hour later, gelatin to clarify my mead. I waited more than a week, but there seemed to be no settlements. I tried cold-crushing, but still, no results. Since I ruined the batch, I started experimenting with the batch. I added dissolved gelatine in boiling hot water, warm water, cold water with undissolved gelatin in it, and I even poured the gelatine powder directly into the fermenter. After all this, there were absolutely no settlements still. I waited a few weeks, but nothing changed, so I dumped them into the sink and started all over with hard cider.

Too many for me to reply to individually, but many thanks to everyone.  Regarding plants:  I've never seen them keep any plants indoors (although one person is an avid outdoor gardener) and regarding wine: I've never seen them drink or serve wine.   I'm now leaning towards taking them out to dinner in their new neighborhood, and baking them something later once they're ready for visitors.  Also, I just impulsively (before I could second guess it!) ordered my favorite candy to be delivered, which I remember one of them enjoying when I brought it to an event; geez, maybe there's hope for me learning to give actual (consumable) gifts!  I really, really hate figuring out what to give people; I know this is weird, but the whole gifting practice feels annoyingly inefficient to me, especially where you're exchanging gifts - feels like two people spend energy figuring out what to give each other, and the result is that each person ends up with something less useful than if they'd just hugged each other and kept the money.   I'd be completely fine if I never received another gift (and for the most part, I don't get any).  My husband and I never gift each other anything, and my grown kids seem fine with my transferring money to them every birthday and Christmas.  When I receive a graduation announcement or wedding/shower invitation, I transfer funds or send a Visa gift card; and when I realize someone needs help, I really make an effort to give them time or money or food.  When we're invited to a party, I always bring something home baked (after checking first with the host).  I don't begrudge giving; I just can't stand the effort at picking stuff out. Now, my problem:  Some very old friends just moved from their house of 30+ years to a new place; these are the nicest folks you can imagine and so I'd like to give them a little something; I thought of my standard Visa gift card but my husband's reaction was \"It's fine but they'll probably think it's kind of silly as they're more affluent than we are\"; does that matter?  Heck, we aren't poor, just careful, retired folks, and $100 isn't a strain.  But is it silly to give more affluent people something which is essentially cash?   Does a gift only make sense in this situation if it's thoughtfully chosen?  Uggh, the idea of choosing a gift just makes my head hurt.
