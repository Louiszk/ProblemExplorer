He wanted to experiment with finding ways to save and generate income from home. He's exceeding all expectations! He tends to a large garden, growing fruits and vegetables, manages fruit and nut trees, mastered the art of canning, prepares all our meals from scratch, excels at household chores, engages in beekeeping as a hobby, attends local beekeeping association meetings, has introduced us to a vibrant community of beekeepers, brews our own beer, and recently acquired the skill of soap-making. I couldn't be prouder of his accomplishments. He sells produce and honey at the Farmers market on weekends during the growing season. It's disheartening how some people perceive his efforts. They unfairly paint him as lazy, disregarding his significant contributions. I had to distance myself from one friend who suggested I should divorce him. It's absurd. If our roles were reversed, with him working and me managing the household, I doubt anyone would question my efforts.

Last week, we visited Slovenia for the first time, together with our dog. We found kind people, great food, clean cities, and breathtaking views. The first incident happened in Ljubljana: a free dog crossed a central street twice to reach our dog and bark at her. Luckily, the dog was small and just annoying, but the owner didn't care much about us or about the cars that had to wait for her dog. She left without saying anything. As beer lovers, we decided to spend two nights in Kamnik to enjoy the guided visit to the famous craft breweries and the city's surrounding areas. While walking in the main pedestrian street, we met an unleashed Belgian Shepherd. Our guide kindly asked the owner to check the dog, but she refused. Less than one minute later, the dog attacked ours. Luckily, we were able to stop it without any injuries. In the end, the owner put the blame on us, saying she always left her dog free and she was in her city. The day after, we took a walk after dinner. While we were at the foot of Mali Grad, we literally had to hide to avoid being noticed by an unleashed German Shepherd. We were worried about encountering other free dogs, so we decided to go back home. Sometimes, small things can have a big and unexpected impact on other people, but not everyone seems to be aware of it. Lep pozdrav!

If I tell my current companion to get lost and go from wherever we're at (\"A\") to settlement \"B,\" the companion will dutifully leave me alone, but never leave location A. If A is a settlement, then the character will stop counting as a member of that settlement and no longer be accessible in the workshop. This happens, as far as I can tell, no matter what settlement I try to send them to. It also happens with the robot that makes your drinks cold--he will not budge from the bottom of the Shamrock Taphouse! With companions, I can at least go back and get them from wherever they plopped themselves down, but there's nothing I can do about the robot. The only workaround for this with companions is to have them as my buddy at location B when I tell them to get lost.

(Originally, this seemed to be a bug in the very first quest in Sanctuary, and I used a mod to fix it, but he's regressed.) Preston is currently wandering around Greygarden, not counting as a member of that settlement, and not doing anything particularly companionable. I think that these are two separate issues. From posts from years ago, I've seen that some people blamed mods that changed settlements for possibly wrecking this somehow, but there was never a lot of detail. I do have one mod that remakes all of the vanilla settlements, but it seems like it's pretty widely distributed. I don't have anything messing with any of my companions. I am willing to try to reset Preston again if anybody thinks that redoing the first quest he gives me (going to another settlement) in order to get him to talk to me again is a good idea.

I also decided that I may as well replace my lines since my old lines were installed about 3 years ago.  After fussing with getting everything connected, I connected my kegs to test everything out, and two problems arose that I haven't be able to figure out.   One of the connectors is leaking where it connects to the shank (the reducer).  At first it leaked really bad, but I disconnected the line from the keg and pulled it underneath thinking the duotight maybe hadn't quick clicked into place.  It's not leaking as bad, but it's still dripping bad enough that I can't leave it connected to the keg or I get a puddle of beer in my kegerator that eventually makes its way onto the floor.   One of the connectors at the keg perpetually shoots out beer when it's connected.  Specifically, n the quick disconnect for the keg I have a duotight connector screwed in, and the beer is coming out the back end of that connector where the tubing goes.  I've tried switching out the quick disconnect, switching the duotight piece, and it's the same deal every single time.   Those issues are on two different taps/lines by the way: the other two taps work perfectly fine. My fear is that for the first problem there's something wrong with either the shank, the reducer, or maybe the tubing.  In any event, I'm worried this will be a pain to replace since those Komos draft towers are quite annoying to connect and disconnect.  Luckily that tap is on the top, so *maybe* I can loosen it and replace whatever is necessary without taking the whole tower off. The second problem really puzzles me.  I tried three different quick disconnects and maybe four duotight connectors, and it's the same deal every time.  My only guess is that something's wrong with the line.  I think the EVABarrier tubing comes in 8mm and 9.5mm OD versions, and I'm 99% sure all my stuff is 8mm, so I don't think I have the wrong size connector (plus, like I said, the other taps work fine).  The tubing was folded up a lot when it arrived and it has some bends in it.  My only guess is that maybe where I cut the tubing it was at one of those bends and that's somehow preventing the tubing from getting all the way into the duotight connector. Anyway, hoping someone out there might have some ideas or insight. Thanks and cheers!

We were in a larger group and one friend brought her bf whom we have met twice before. The 2 previous times before he was a bit intense but he was relatively alright and we were looking forward to seeing him...or so I thought. This lad probably means well but every extremely poor behaviour is met with 'well X had ADHD' or 'you can't tell x what to do, he has ADHD' or 'oh you'll never have a full conversation with X because he has adhd'. I have adhd diagnosed adhd which X does not have and I don't act like that. I struggle to fathom how at 30 something year old you can do whatever the fudge you please and when anyone says anything you can just say 'I have adhd'. Jesus I must have been missing a trick because I didn't realise I could just be doing whatever I pleased as an adult and just say sorry I fudged with your shit and break it after 7 times of you asking me not to touch it but I have adhd so it's not my fault. You know those kids that bounce around, scream at the top of their lungs when they don't get attention, touch and play with things without asking or doing it after it being expressedly told not to. The ones who know they're in trouble and dead look you in the eye and do it anyway then laugh as your stuff breaks...imagine a 30 something year old of that.

He couldn't even step out the side door for a cigarette. He couldn't even go to the fridge to get a beer this guy was that bad and defiant.

I was speechless, I've never met such a mentally regressed adult who 'functions' as a normal person in society. This friend is an integrated friend and her boyfriend is a total tw*t that having spoken to several group members separately, hate him but won't say it to her because she's 7 years deep and they like and want to support her. We have been integrated longer and are normal human beings who until this utter spanner came in all got along without a fight for years. Now we can't be harmonious because of literally 1 person. Do we just separate from the group? Or do I stick to my guns and make him as uncomfortable as he makes us? I can't even look at this person again they are that bad. Their face now makes mine and my husbands skin crawl. My mother absolutely despises this guy too and his poor gf thinks my mum loves him.

My friends parents both passed in the same year, and I'm helping him with the declaring his inheritance this year. He's one of my best friends, lives in another country (still has a US tax filing obligation) and doesn't know up from down when it comes to this stuff.  We chat on a regular basis, usually Saturday evenings around a few (too many) beers. Last Saturday evening, we spent a good amount of time shooting the shit and discussing his tax situation. On Monday, I get a message on WhatsApp from him (or so I thought).  It was a very casual message asking about renouncing his citizenship out of curiosity.  The message wasn't addressed like \"Hey Hobo, I have a question about x\", It was just a casual 'Also, just out of curiosity, what would it take to renounce my citizenship?'. I casually fielded his questions, he had a few more questions to the point where he asked if he could call me.  At the moment, I was on the toilet and needed to rush out the door.  So being one of my best friends I told him \"nah, can't right now mate.  Taking a massive shit and running out the door to the doctor's appointment'. We texted back and forth until he started asking me questions that have nothing to do with his actual situation.  I started scrolling up to re-read the discussion, and then realize...I'm not talking to my best friend....I'm talking to one of my biggest clients .  Investment banker.  Clears 1mm a year.  Pays a big fat check to me for doing his taxes every year. I never usually give out my personal number to clients.  Too many people that call 'quick questions' constantly blowing up my phone.  But this client is an exception, and is very effective at communicating.  Also, does not try to call me immediately after I send him a text (I fucking hate that).  His profile photo is nearly identical to my friend's (both taking a selfie in a tuxedo in the mirror, similar colored backgrounds, etc.).  The opening message from the client on Monday morning  'Also, just out of curiosity..' was him continuing a discussion we had from a week before. I'm so used to very frequently receiving WhatsApp messages with such a similar photo, I just defaulted to thinking it was my friend without even reading the name.   His questions were also at first very much aligned with what my friend and I were discussing on Saturday night. Responded, apologizing to the client, explaining the situation, I'm so embarrassed and to please excuse my familiar language.  I'm lucky this client is cool, young (late 40s), laid back, etc. as opposed to some of the other clients who could have taken offense to my slip up.

My bf and I have been together for over 4 years, and although his drinking habits have gotten a bit better, they are still the root of almost all of our issues. He gets mean when he's really drunk, and although it doesn't happen much anymore, I think I have like PTSD from it, so even a sip of alcohol puts me on edge. I'll go into a slight timeline of how things are. When we first started dating, his drinking was a big issue. He was 20 then, but he would get blacked out at his friends house often and act like an asshole. We had a lot of fights, broke up twice, etc. He came to my sorority date party and got black out drunk and we were asked to leave. After while, he moved into a house with his friends. The drinking was a lot more consistent being 21 and living with 3 other guys who also liked to drink a lot. Same thing, he'd get really drunk and then I'm left to deal with him, his puke, and his pee if he was black out. We moved in together about 3 years ago, and it's been a constant fight. There's been a lot of the above in the beginning leading to keeping no alcohol in the house and me watching how much he drinks when we go out. Over the last year, it's been a lot better in the sense of quantity drinking. But almost anytime we go out with his friends, he drinks too much and I have to stop him from drinking, for my own personal safety when we get home. Yesterday, we were out with friends almost all day at their pool. He drank 2 drinks with lunch (Cinco De Mayo) and then proceeded to have 16 beers in 6 hours. When I suggested he take a break and drink water, he drinks water and immediately grabs another beer. Then I tell him he needs to be done because he's slurring his words and slightly stumbling around, and he agrees with me and says sounds good. Then I see him going for another beer, I go and grab it and pour it out. He stops drinking after that. On the way home, we got into a fight about why he continued to try and drink when he says he's done. Then it became a huge thing that brought up old issues and stuff. So I guess what I'm trying to figure out is if his drinking has improved enough for me to stay. He's been black out maybe 2 or 3 times this past year (12 months, not 2024) but still drinks slightly heavy on the weekends. He would drink more if I wasn't there watching him or telling him more. I'm not sure I want to deal with this the rest of my life and start a family with this guy. He's been saying we're getting engaged soon, and all I can think about is I'll have to watch him at our wedding too. Note: when he doesn't drink, he's great. He doesn't drink during the week besides an occasional drink with dinner if we eat out. It's the weekend that's an issue, so much where I begin to dread the weekend because I know I'll have to go out with him and his friends (who are also my friends we had the same friend group before dating) to watch him. I'm much more of a home body and would love to spend weekends relaxing. What are your thoughts?

We're a relatively young brewery (but I've personally been brewing professionally for 9 years) that has been serving draft only through our taproom up until this point. We've seen a pretty steep rise in sales through self distro with these cans but we've been getting some pretty inconsistent results as far as dissolved oxygen in the canned product goes. We don't have a D.O. meter of our own but our mobile canner does. They are able to take a reading of the beer in the brite tank before we start filling and all of our brands are consistently starting below 10ppb in the brite. They are running a 5 head Wild Goose and they are consistently checking seams throughout the run so I don't see any issue there and they are regularly checking cans to get D.O readings on each of the five fill heads. The issue we're having is often with the first few D.O. checks they're telling me that they are sometimes hitting around 100ppb but then they are able to make some adjustments after a few cases and get the readings down anywhere between 35-60ppb on all fill heads. Unfortunately, we're somewhat regularly seeing a pretty fast decline in the beer stability, particularly in our hop forward beers, a lot faster than I would expect. By week 2 or 3 you'd think you were drinking a 5 or 6 week old beer, especially when compared to that same beer served on draft in our tap room. So first, I'm wondering what kind of D.O. numbers are you all deeming as acceptable in your packaged product? The last place I worked at we were typically getting numbers around 40ppb in our canned beer and the shelf stability was pretty solid. Are the numbers we're getting numbers that you would be fine with? Second, is there something else that maybe I'm missing on my end? We're extremely diligent with our processes in regards to purging tanks and hoses when we transfer, making sure there's a solid blanket of CO2 when we dry hop, etc. I see the numbers that they're getting and I just wouldn't expect such a fast drop off in the canned product with those numbers, but maybe they are too high?

With the lemon and mint I'm not adding any sugar, so what is it that's making it so much more fizzy? I'm pretty sure that it is fermenting, because the taste is changing and a scoby is forming in the bottle. If any of you know what's going on, and how I can fix that, it would be greatly appreciated!

Now is trying to rejoin our circle of mutual friends, and i am struggling with it extremely hard.   Originally posted to  r/relationship_advice   TRIGGER WARNING:  emotional abuse and manipulation, abandonment, severe depression   Original Post \u00c2 Apr 6, 2020  Me and a girl who i will just call Jessica, were a couple for 8+ years and engaged for 3+ of them. I met her through a mutual friend in my group of friends. We ended up hitting it off pretty quickly as our dorky/nerdy hobbies aligned really well. I personally fully expected to marry this person, and spend the rest of my life with her. In early 2016 her job offered her an amazing opportunity to temporarily work 4 months in the companies satellite office New Zealand (she was an Environmental Engineer), to temporarily manage and lead a new team. It was very sudden, and i was not really happy with the idea, but she really wanted this chance and opportunity. So off she went. I flew out to visit her after ~2 months, only when i arrived at the airport i got a text message from her. The message was short and more or less consisted of \"she was sorry but after thinking it through, she thinks it would be best if we went our separate ways from now on\". She then completely blocked me on almost every single form of social media, cell phone, etc. I was confused, devastated and became an absolute wreck. I remember completely breaking down in Auckland Airport. I spent the next 4 days living at a motel basically trying to get into contact with her in any shape or form. She had apparently blocked everyone of our circle of friends. Even her close friends from our circle of friends were shocked, confused and basically lost. Even her parents were extremely confused when i called them, her dad who i was extremely close with (we coached pee-wee hockey together, and played a lot of beer league for hockey together), refused to believe it at first. I was a mess for a solid year, but my close circle of friends managed to drag me out of my hellish hole along with some therapy. Her best friends became close friends to me. About a year ago, she invited some of her old close friends to her wedding among a bunch of other people from our group. No one went, and i quickly found out which hurt me even more. Over a year ago i started dating one of her old friends, as me and her had gotten close over the last 2 years or so. She felt quite hurt when Jessica basically ghosted her. Unfortunately there was some awkwardness because she fully knew i was not fully over my ex, but she has been a supportive and amazing person and i am extremely happy with her. Life was going great for me. Then in December Jessica apparently moved back home after divorcing a few months after getting married. I don't know much and i don't want to know. However she is making this hugely concentrated effort to reconnect with people in our friend group, which is resulting in some very conflicted feelings for some people. Last week i found out that Jessica and some of my friends have started playing D&D (via roll20), which frankly made me feel like shit. Part of my just wants to move on from this but i am struggling hard. While my SO has been extremely supportive, i just feel numb and dont really know what to do. Today Jessica sent me a long facebook message basically apologizing to me for what she did, and asked to be friends. I didn't respond and blocked her. I told my SO, and i just felt like i was going to break down. Right now my SO is saying she is worried about me, and keeps asking me what do i want to do. My SO confessed that Jessica had sent her a similar message a few weeks ago, and she told her off. I don't know what i am supposed to do, i can't order my friends to not be friends with her. I just feel like a mess and i am struggling with this as i feel like i am teenager dealing with stupid drama again. TLDR; EX Fiancee of 8+ years dumped me via text message after i flew across the world to see her. Now she is trying to reconnect with everyone and i am struggling very hard with this. What should i do?  Update \u00c2 Apr 14, 2020  Thank you all for your wonderful support, anyways i have tried my best to follow everyone's advice. I sat down with my SO and explained to her how awesome she, is and explained how i don't have any romantic feelings for my ex at all, all i really have is a lot of painful and hurtful memories. I also asked her what should i do, and she suggested i respond and tell her off, to get closure of some degree. So i did that, i told her:   I don't want to be friends anymore   I want nothing to do with her   I explained how badly she hurt me   I am happy right now and i just want her to leave me and my friends alone   She took it well, apologized one more time and then basically said \"goodbye forever\". That was honestly a huge load off my shoulders. I then went and told our group of friends, and explained how much she hurt me, and how i would rather we not start adding her to our gaming sessions etc. Unfortunately i ended up losing a bunch of friends and have irreparably caused a lot of damage to our friends group. Many of them sided with me, but a bunch of them took the stance of \"You have no right to tell me who i can be friends with\" among other complaints. A few people were very angry, and told me i am being a terrible person as my EX is trying to repent, and deal with pain of her divorce. It was confusing and frankly just made everything more of a mess. In the end, a bunch of us ended up getting booted out of our FF14 free company, which then my SO ended up kicking out of bunch of people from our discord. I don't really know what is going to happen.\u00c2\u00a0 But it really hurt to see some people i have known for years, and even helped me get through it the first time suddenly take her side. TLDR; Told my ex off, explained to people in our group of friends how she hurt me, it ended up breaking our circle of friends.
