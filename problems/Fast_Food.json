Before me, she was eating microwavable mac and cheese, jarred alfredo and noodles, salad kits and pretty much nothing else ever. Doesn't cook at all. Those things are fine or whatever, but I can't eat that everyday. I'm an amateur chef, and I like to cook. Like most days. I'm not into any crazy expensive meals or anything, but I'll put $30 into a grocery store run and make food for us all the time. At the very least, if I'm using pesto from a jar, I'll go buy some cherry tomatoes and keep parmesan around. That's too much to her. She doesn't want to contribute to dinner like ever claiming she's fine with microwavable ramen for dinner and can't afford to pay for groceries all the time (she makes $55k per year and we split all expenses half and half) so I end up footing the grocery bill every time I cook.  I understand, there's no way to change her relationship with food. There's no way to change mine. I'll just buy the groceries. (We go on grocery trips together where we split the costs 50-50, we just happen to only get stuff like drinks, snacks, common ingredients sometimes.  Never full ingredient lists for meals) So like 3 times per week, I get the urge to cook something cool and go buy all the ingredients myself, never charging her So I make meals sometimes like giant pots of curry or enchiladas. Before we moved in officially, I'd take most of the leftovers home or sometimes all. I'd take the leftovers with me to work too. She claims that I'm being possessive over food and that I'm not thinking about her when I take food. I bought frozen breakfast burritos for a pre work in a hurry meal, and she was eating them for lunch at home when there's other stuff to eat. I had an issue with that because they're for me on certain rushed mornings so I don't have to stop and get fast food. Of course she thinks that's the most unattractive quality in a partner that I did that. I think it's hypocritical that she says \"I didn't ask you to cook that food for me, I shouldn't have to pay for the groceries\" while simultaneously believing \"that's so selfish of you to not leave me leftovers when you cook\"  It's not like I'm leaving her with no food. There's all kinds of stuff to eat around the place, ramen and all. She just would rather eat the good food that I cooked. I don't make that much money. Probably about 2/3 of what she makes. I'm relatively frugal and don't like to eat out much, so expensive meals are my version of that at times. I always feed her, but am I actually selfish for this mentality? For the record, I still leave her leftovers most times I cook. I'm absolutely not possessive over it, just sometimes take ownership of the things I make all by myself    "], ["The problem with tipping 0% at a restaurant", "45", "0", "2024-06-27T05:38:44.659000+0000", "https://www.reddit.com/r/tipping/comments/1dpju3s/the_problem_with_tipping_0_at_a_restaurant/", "I know a lot of people in this subreddit are anti-tipping and will choose to tip 0% when the option is presented to them. When it comes to fast-food chains and coffee shops, there's usually no consequence to either party involved if the tip option is skipped. Servers, on the other hand, will often suffer if you tip 0%. For those who don't know, in most restaurants the Back of House (cooks, dishwashers, Bussers, etc) will receive a weekly/biweekly sum of cash that is their equivalent of a \u00e2\u0080\u009ctip\u00e2\u0080\u009d. Each server contributes a percentage of their sales (note: not tips) to the tip out pool. The tip out is automatically calculated, and is deducted from each server's tips at the end of the night. For example, if I sell $1000 worth of food and my restaurant's tip out is 5%, then $50 is taken from whatever I earned that night to distribute amongst the BOH. This is not optional for us. What this means is that for anything you order, we pay a percentage of that cost to other staff members. When you choose to tip 0% your server is still obliged to tip out, meaning the act of serving you has cost them a portion of their wages. If you had a positive experience with a server but don't feel inclined to tip them, you can always pull another employee aside and ask what the tip out percentage is at the restaurant. At most, this would be 3-5%. Covering the cost of tip out means that your server nets $0, which would be equivalent to not tipping at the aforementioned fast food/coffee shops. I'm not trying to convince anti-tippers to suddenly start tipping 20%. You have your reasons for not supporting tip culture, and I have to respect that. All I ask is that you try to be aware of this in the future.

We're one of the few families (3.5 million people in total) that were affected by the 'Indentured Labour' policies of the British Empire, the slave trade that often gets brushed over in favor of the African slave trade. My ancestors were taken from Gujarat to East Africa, before being liberated and moving to Britain, with myself completing the full cycle, settled back in India again. I was brought up in a very liberal Vaishnava Lohana household; my family were very chilled out about most things: meat eating, smoking, drinking and even dating, alongside being very relaxed about our Hinduism, with a 9 day meat-free fast annually for Navratri and Raksha Bandhan being the only things we really did to express our Hinduness . One thing that always struck me as odd was why our family, despite being so 'modern', always had one sticking issue, which was with Islam. As I delved deeper into my Hindu/Gujarati/Lohana history, and learnt more about my gotra (which I won't share here as it would likely give away too much about my identity), I decided that I'd sit down with the family and ask some questions on why there's a zero tolerance policy towards Islam shared between all of the elders, from my parents, uncles and aunties, all the way to my great grandmother. Now being a practicing Vaishnava myself, ditching the: meat, alcohol, smoking and drugs, I feel as though it's only fair for our voices to be heard, So... here goes nothing.  Reasons:   1.) Pushtimarg - Vallabhacharya Sampradaya:   The migration of Shreenathji (Thakorji) from Govardhan Hills to Nathdwara.  Coming from a Lohana background, like most of our community, we tend to follow Shreenathji, with one side of the family having great devotion in 'Sant Jalaram Bappa'. Without delving into the religious significance too much; Shreenathji's Murti first appeared in Govardhan, Mathura, in 1409, discovered and venerated by Shree Vallabhacharya in 1549 - worshipped across the entirety of ' Brajdham ' and surrounding areas. This devotion carried on until it was disturbed by the Islamic invader, Aurangzeb, who ordered the complete destruction of all of Vrindavan and all mandirs dedicated to Shreenathji. Knowing that the order had been given to destroy the original Murti, devotees of Shreenathji, against the will of the people, were forced to lift the Murti out of it's native place, escaping with it in exile for over 32 months at risk to their own lives, until they could find a kingdom to protect it. Their pleas to protect Shreenathji's Murti were rejected by multiple Hindu princely states, who were either too scared or in alliance with Aurangzeb, until Maharana Rajsingh of Mewar vowed to protect the Murti in Udaipur. Finally, in 1672, the Murti was placed in Nathdwara with a whole mandir being built for it, which still stands to this day, which we've all been to. Had it not been for the Mewar Kingdom, almost overnight, the entire Sampradaya would have fallen apart and Islam would have dominated over the entire faith - my grandparents are not only disturbed that our entire belief system could have been wiped out at the hands of one Islamic ruler, but are also disturbed by the fact that the Murti still hasn't been returned back to its rightful place in Govardhan nearly 80 years on from partition. Invaders were only days away from destroying our entire sect, which is still practiced in 2023; this entire history has left an incredibly sour taste in their mouths.  2.) Native Lohana community and our expulsion from Iran / Afghanistan.  Lohanas today are mostly settled in Gujarat, Mumbai & across the UK. Lohanas, 'Suryavanshi', trace their roots back to Shri Ram through a Luv/Kush paternal lineage - often thought of as a Kshatriya clan. Between the 7th and 11th century, Lohanas fought off the Mohammedans successfully in the numerous battles for Afghanistan, until they were pushed back into the Sindh province in modern day Pakistan, until they were persecuted there by Islamists until fleeing to Gujarat. We have direct lineage to numerous soldiers who fought the invaders and were killed in battle, alongside coordinates of temples in records that our community and family members would have built. This history and all of these relics have now been destroyed due to the expansion of the Islamic caliphate which has managed to completely dominate over Afghanistan, a land that my ancestors once decorated and cherished with pride. Today, all that remains is barren sand towns and various coins/broken architecture that were collected by archeologists to prove the ancient Lohana history that used to reside there. Once again, they find it incredibly disturbing that our entire community was subject to genocide, with few escaping, with their descendants living practically nowhere near their native place today. Even Gujarat isn't our ' home ' per se, it's merely one of the few places left where we won't be persecuted for our faith and heritage.  3.) East Africa - Diwali/Eid Food  Whilst living in East Africa, Hindus and Muslims lived side by side to one another. One experience that has always stuck with my family is the exchanges of food. Every Diwali, my family would prepare food to give to serve at the mandir and give to the local community; with this, they also gave food to the Muslims. In exchange, the Muslims would give Hindus their food, sometimes accidentally slipping in some beef and serving non veg bhaajis to the more orthodox, but still friendly Hindus of EA. One year, my great grandmother found all of the food that she'd given to the Muslim families in the bin. When she confronted the families about the numerous parcels she'd found in the bin, they told her that they didn't want to hurt her feelings and reject the food, but they couldn't eat 'prasad' as it was first laid out in 'Ankot', essentially where you first 'feed' food to Bhagwan, before serving it - this would be an act of 'shirk', or sin in Islam. This broke her heart, that all of her and our families efforts were just.. put in the bin. She never forgave them for doing this to the day she died, she saw it as an act of deep betrayal. Going forwards, she never accepted any Eid offerings and broke most of her friendships up with said community.  4.) And there's more...  There's a lot more that they mentioned, often linking back to the personal treatment of our people in India, Pakistan and Bangladesh, alongside the continued mistreatment of Hindus in the UK. The multiple Razings of Somnath Mandir, Gujarat - 16 times if I remember correctly, at the hands of Islamists, also came up. My Dada mentioned, 'In India today, we need prolonged court cases to rebuild mandirs; if Somnath is destroyed once more, then it will likely not be rebuilt for another 100 years' - this really stuck with me. Thinking about what Hindus had to go through to get our own Ram Janmabhoomi built in the native homeland of Hindus is quite frankly disturbing and only proves his point. Whilst we're all up in arms for the rights of natives who were otherwise genocided in the Americas, Africas or Australia.... we, the natives of India, are labelled as 'bigoted' when asking for anything that protects our native people who still live on. I didn't go any further in the conversation with them as it was starting to infuriate my Dadimaa and I didn't want to put any more stress on her, but, there you have it!  End:  I guess one might ask the reason 'why' I felt the need to write this. In the UK, Gujaratis are often accused as unfairly prejudiced towards Muslims and having a certain degree of hostility, not seen in other Indian communities, and I wanted to find out whether that was the truth. Whilst I'm not sure I could buy into the idea of 'collective guilt' when it comes to the actions of all Muslims based on the interactions that my own family have had with them, I guess this is somewhat of an explanation as to where the 'hostility' comes from, at least, from my own families perspective.

More information - I started trying to learn Ukrainian through Duolingo and I'm not super far in, but what inspired me to start learning was a customer at my work. There is an older gentleman who is Ukrainian and he's very kind but he doesn't speak English very well. He told my manager (with a slightly upset look on his face) that he was Ukrainian when he overheard him say Russian the first time we really ran into a language barrier issue. I've also seen his passport and he's definitely Ukrainian. Emphasis on the Ukrainian because of the question and the words he uses sometimes versus what I'm learning on Duolingo. He comes to talk to me frequently and also one of my coworkers who is Ukrainian but she moved to America when she was 3 and says sometimes he speaks too fast for her to understand what he is saying. I started out using Google translate to try to communicate with him but he often replies in Ukrainian which I couldn't understand and my phone had a rough time translating. I began learning on Duolingo and I've tried talking to him a little bit in Ukrainian, it started with little words, like \u00d0\u00b4\u00d0\u00be\u00d0\u00b1\u00d1\u0080\u00d0\u00b8\u00d0\u00b9 \u00d0\u00b4\u00d0\u00b5\u00d0\u00bd\u00d1\u008c and if he had certain food in his cart I'd try to say the word in Ukrainian. But sometimes I've noticed that I will say a word as I learned it on Duolingo and he will say it is a different word, and we have a security guard who is Russian and he says \"that is the word in Russian.\" The first time this happened was with the word for food. On Duolingo it says that food is \u00d1\u0097\u00d0\u00b6a but he said something that sounded like \"peesha\" (I don't know how it would be spelled) but it has happened with other words like he says \"da\" for \"yes\"    "], ["How do I [F20] navigate and resolve this issue with my boyfriend [M26]?", "31", "2", "2024-01-03T02:46:54.094000+0000", "https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/18x8cae/how_do_i_f20_navigate_and_resolve_this_issue_with/", "TL;DR:  BF makes food that makes me sick, so I started to prepare my own food. BF eats my food because he enjoys eating \u00e2\u0080\u009cmeals cooked by girlfriend.\u00e2\u0080\u009d BF won't agree to me making his own serving, so I make spicy food. BF upset I make spicy food so he won't eat my food. Conflict leads to rent problems.  So, I've started to pack my own meals whenever I know I'll be at my partner's place or if he's coming over to my place. The meals I prepare ahead of time are always spicy. The only reason I make them spicy is because I know my partner won't be able to eat it. The reason I started doing this is because I started to lose a lot of weight whenever I was around him. The food he'd prefer was food I just couldn't learn to stomach. It would make me feel sick. I really tried to learn to enjoy it, but I couldn't. And to be honest I wanted to be careful with the amount I ate because it can make certain health issues worse. I tried offering to teach him how I cook my meals so we could figure out how to cook meals we could both enjoy. Or at least food we can enjoy together once in a while because I understand how important it is to have food we personally/individually enjoy. We don't have to share and do everything together. (Which is a big thing for him. It's caused a lot of conflict.)  I tried cooking meals that I know he likes and he did seem to enjoy them, but he preferred cooking his meals his way. That's fine. Completely understandable. The issue I'm struggling with is that whenever I brought my own food, that wasn't spicy, he would eat my food and guilt trip me into eating his food. Normally I don't mind sharing, but since he eats a lot more than I do he ends up eating most or all of my food. I would try to ration what was left for my meals. He would try to guilt trip me into eating food that would make me feel sick and if I couldn't do it he would feel insulted. I tried preparing more of my food, offered to bring an extra serving for him, but he would decline an extra serving yet still ate my food. I kept making more and more, but nothing changed. He would eat my food and then make his food and ask why I wouldn't eat his. It caused me to lose a lot of weight to the point family and friends got concerned. I never really realized how much weight I lost until I weighed myself. So, I started to make spicy food for myself which doesn't bother me at all because I love spicy and was raised on it. I noticed whenever I made a spicy dish he would consistently not touch it. I started to make more and he noticed an increase in my spicy food. He asked if I make spicy food so he won't eat my food and I confirmed his suspicions. He was joking when he asked, but when I said \u00e2\u0080\u0098Yes' he got upset. He asked if I didn't like his cooking or offered food, why I couldn't enjoy his food, that he felt I didn't like it because it was \u00e2\u0080\u009cbudget food\u00e2\u0080\u009d as he called it,  and generally expressed upset and sadness because I wouldn't eat his food. I explained that I tried to like it, but I just couldn't. It would upset my stomach too much. It would cause me to feel sick. Lots of time on the toilet and throwing up. (Which he gave me shit for and would laugh at me for it with his friends.)  I thought I could get used to it because it's food I never grew up on while for him it was. I thought with enough time I'd get used to it because he eats it just fine. I tried for so long because I was raised to always eat food out of respect. I didn't want to upset him and I feel bad that I just can't get used to it. I just don't know what to do. He tried buying me food, but would then finish my food for me because I wouldn't eat it fast enough. (I struggle to eat a certain amount of food and quickly, so I like to put it aside for later. Always been a slow eater.)  He would then get upset with me because he bought me food I won't finish even though I never asked him to buy me food. He would wake me up with food he already bought, which is sweet of him and I do appreciate it, but it causes conflict and I don't understand why. He'd say since he spends money on me it makes him struggle to pay for rent and so I end up helping him with rent because I feel bad.  ( I also started making my own food so he won't have a reason to buy me food then get mad at me.)  I've tried telling him he does not need to spend money on me. I never asked for it, I don't need or want it, and I don't want him to feel like he needs to buy me stuff over being able to afford rent. When I said that he got upset asking if I think he's incapable of managing his own bills. I explained that I'd much rather he take care of himself first. Especially since I don't really need the things he's buying me and honestly don't care too much for them. He'd buy me electronics, video games, and clothes then would give me shit for not playing games with him 24/7 or not always wearing the clothes he bought me. I don't know what to do. I'm so confused by this. I don't understand why this is such a huge issue or how it became such a huge issue. I never would have thought that preparing food I can eat would cause a mess like this. I don't know how to resolve this issue or move forward.

I (20F) have been dating my boyfriend (19M) for a bit over a year now. He's a complete sweetheart, he has a huge heart and is an emotional guy (not in an aggressive way; he just has big feelings about things and cries easily). These are things I honestly lve about him, but I'm worried things are starting to go downhill. For some background, he has pretty severe OCD and ADHD. He's been diagnosed and medicated since he was about 8, and had to go through some pretty intense exposure therapy for a while. He's overall very functional and operates normally. I, on the other hand, also have severe OCD and ADHD, as well as generalized anxiety and depression. (All professionally diagnosed on both sides, don't worry.) The difference is, I was only diagnosed 2 years ago (ADHD) and this year (OCD). My main issue is this: I feel that he's progressively gotten too comfortable with me and my family. Obviously I want him to feel comfortable, but it's to the point where he treats my house as his own (eg. leaving clothes on the floor, not putting things away, leaving old food/drinks out everywhere, etc.) I feel like I am constantly asking for him to do small things, and he always takes it harshly. For example, I've nicely asked him several times to not leave trash in my room. My contamination OCD is severe, and I will go into a panicked cleaning spree and not be able to sleep if there are germs/garbage in my room. I also get super irritable, which I try to let leave my system before I say anything about it to him. Essentially, I feel like I'm not asking much, but whenever I ask him to change small things about his lifestyle he gets really emotional and treats it as if I'm attacking his personality. He definitely has made small improvements, but not to the capacity I've expected. He sometimes remembers to pick up his garbage from my room, but he'll still leave stuff all over the rest of the house. It feels as if I have to parent him, sometimes. My main question is, how should I approach this problem in a way that won't make him defensive? Am I asking for too much? Should I give it more time for change to come into effect? It's put a strain on our relationship and I'm really not sure where to go from here. I love him and want this to last long-term, but I truly don't know if it will if these things persist. Additional things that have happened:   I've had to bribe him to brush his teeth at night, and that's only the nights he spends with me. I don't think he brushes at night at all when he's at his house, though I know he does in the morning.   He has really poor eating habits, which comes mostly from his upbringing. My family has always been a home-cooked meal (or at least healthier takeout) family, while he grew mostly on fast food. I'm genuinely concerned about his health moving forward, but he refuses to eat healthy a lot of the time.   His car is a mess, and it's definitely gotten better. But most days I get in his car, there's at least one old drink and an old bag of food laying on the ground.   he complains about his stomach issues and headaches often but won't go to the doctor. I have volunteered to schedule him an appointment but he refuses and says he'll do it himself. He's been saying this for a few months now.   Again; he's a genuinely good person with a good heart. I think he lets his mental illness control him more than it needs to, and his willpower is taken over by his desire to avoid discomfort. Let me know your opinions, and please be kind. Thank you in advance, all I'm seeking is clarity in a situation I don't know how to navigate.    "], ["Issue with 2 cockatiels. Wont let the other eat in peace at all.

I try to be as understanding as possible, but he also refuses to get help and sometimes I wonder how he is even still alive considering how little he actually WILL eat.

He often claims he is allergic to these things, despite allergy tests clearing him of having any allergies at all. Like I said, I completely understand having aversions to foods, flavors, textures, etc. however, the thing that really upsets me is that he will find a way to have a problem with anything and everything that he didn't cook or order from a fast food restaurant. Even foods that do not contain anything he has an aversion to, he will claim that there is something in it. He acts like whoever cooked the food is trying to poison him.

I'm using a new gamemode account because my other gamemode account is for branding, so I decided to make a personal one for more personal things. Anyways. Some background: I just reached level 23 a month ago. For most of my levels 13-17 my character struggled with the depression, ptsd, and anxiety debuffs because of early game trauma from the tutorial Guardians. I visited other therapist players to get help during that time in my playthrough, but my character's issues got worse and I had to visit a few long term mental institution spawn points to get help with my character's debuffs. My character was in these types of spawn points for at most 2 levels. When my character changed spawns to his original spawn, he had to take some potions daily to help with the debuffs and pretty soon the debuffs went away. But because of all of his levels being spent consumed by serious debuffs, he never did the \u00e2\u0080\u009cDrivers License\u00e2\u0080\u009d or the \u00e2\u0080\u009cGo to Work after School\u00e2\u0080\u009d quests. My character ended up getting his first real money making questline when he got to level 18. That was after he did the \u00e2\u0080\u009cJob Corps\u00e2\u0080\u009d quest and got some kinda useful kinda not certifications and a HSD. The first quest in the money making questline was hard for him. It was almost full time and he didnt enjoy it. The quest rewards were bad, only 7.25 coins an hour because his regions minimum wage is a smaller region in the north of the US server. He moved a lot during this period, home region was the Colorado region, moved to the Texas region for the mental help spawn point, then back to Colorado to put more creds into the learning questline. Did the job corps quest in the Colorado region as well, and moved up north when he was done because while he was doing \u00e2\u0080\u009cJob Corps,\u00e2\u0080\u009d his adopted Guardians moved. Anyways, my character has had several fast food quests, most of them he either moved villages and had to get new fast food quests or he was kicked off the questline because of poor attendance habits. My character also suffers from the ADHD status effect, which helps a lot with being creative and playing video games but bores him during uninteresting job type missions. I dont really know what to do anymore. My character had the homeless debuff for a little while during that time period after he moved out of his Guardians spawn point, and ended up in the youth shelter (under level 21). His Guardians eventually helped him with his own spawn point. That was almost 3 levels ago. In that time my character has tried many many more job questlines to cover rent and he's hated all of them. I want to make it clear. My character does not hate working in general. In fact during the job corps quest where he gained 2 levels, he got really into the IT and server management questline, and even though he wasnt earning coins, he was learning about servers and networking and he enjoyed it a lot. But because of the global pandemic game event, he got fast tracked before he could get the one certification he needed to start working IT. So basically he got kicked from that questline with no perk tree skills other than a HSD and Microsoft Office. Now hes stuck working fast food quests that he hates for 20 hours a week because he mentally cant handle working more because the depression debuff comes back hard. Especially if the quest isnt something interesting. Cant afford the college path and doesnt want crippling coin debt. My character is just looking for some advice to help him go to a job he hates full time while he saves up coins to get the certification needed to work in IT.

The scope of this problem is so fucking deep that it goes beyond food. It's consumption, mental illness, nonexistent willpower, moral failings, and a constant need for dopamine and I have no idea what the fuck to do.\u00c2\u00a0 I remember when I was a kid I would sneak to the snack cupboard and literally stuff my face with granola bars. I think early on I was taught that food=comfort. I cared so much about it, my life revolved around it. The act of eating food was paramount. For most kids, it is, kind of, but I think it went beyond with me. For example, when I was 12 I went for dinner at a friends house and his dad, who was a chef, was making mini-pizzas. I had 30. Everyone else went outside to play, and I kept eating pizza. His dad thought it was funny, a challenge. I ate as fast and as much as possible without really thinking about it. My parents fed me well, I wasn't starving, it wasn't a trauma response, i think it was just a greedy part of my personality manifesting. It turned into a trauma response later.\u00c2 When I was 14, my cousin, who was like a brother to me, was murdered by my half-cousin along with my aunt and uncle. I turned to food to cope. We ate out all the time in that period.\u00c2\u00a0 I would run away from the wake (the wake lasted three days) to stuff my face with cannolis and lasagna for as long as I could to gain a little scrape of dopamine. And that continued for the rest of my life. In college, I spent most of my time drinking and sleeping but would spend so much money on pizza and fast food.\u00c2\u00a0\u00c2 When I graduated and stopped living in a city and being active and walking everywhere, my habits caught up with me. I became sedentary. I was never small but from age 25-30 I have gone from 250 pounds to 450, where I am now. It hurts to move and breathe and my chest hurts and I think I am going to die soon. And this is where I have no idea how to turn things around. This is how bad it is. I get fast food, secretly, 5 times a week minimum. I eat gas station food as many times a week. I have 2-3 energy drinks per day.\u00c2 My car is literally full of fast food bags. I have spent thousands of dollars on fast food. I will attempt to drive past fast food establishments and have a hyperventilating panic attack until I pull around. I will sneak out of the house to get fast food.\u00c2 I drink a two-liter of diet every other day. My legs throb and I have bulging varicose veins. I am so addicted to caffeine that I start to shake when i don't have it. I fog eat, eat my wife's food, overeat constantly,\u00c2\u00a0 and I have anxiety attacks whenever I don't have \u00e2\u0080\u009cenough to eat\u00e2\u0080\u009d. For example, today, I had a bag of tosito chips, a bottle of diet coke, a sausage mcmuffin, 2 celsius energy drinks, a steak egg and cheese on a bagel.\u00c2 I spent at least 30 percent of my weekly paycheck on food. I have maxed out credit cards, stolen money (yeah I have sunk that low jesus fucking CHRIST), and been an absolute piece of shit in almost every way. people LOVE ME and I think I love them but I might just be a fucking sociopath because somehow FOOD IS MORE IMPORTANTI don't know where my personality starts and where my mental illness folds into this and how dperession and how and if anxiety fits into this.\u00c2\u00a0 I have no idea how to unravel this, no idea how to be better, no idea if i'm an irredeemable piece of shit, no idea if i should scorch earth.

Like she lost 45 pounds or so. I knew she was eating less but I thought it was in a healthy manner. For example if we got fast food she would get a burger and either not get fries or share them. Come to find out she has only been eating a 1000 calories or so a day for months according to what she was tracking in the Fitbit app. I don't know how accurate she has been tracking either because I didn't know she was until today. She weighs 116lbs and is 5'4\u00e2\u0080\u009d. I am going to talk to her tomorrow about how eating so little is not healthy but I need some info. According to a tdee calculator she should weight between 120 and 130 and consuming 1600 calories. Is this accurate? Also my worst fear is she might have an eating disorder and I don't know how to tell. Do I call her pediatrician tomorrow? Do I address her calories with her and see if it was just ignorance? I don't want to give her a complex and I feel like I got to be careful in how I approach this. Also if there is a better sub for this please let me know. Edit. She is 14. We are going to talk to her and come from the side of giving her information. Meaning there are healthy and unhealthy ways to lose weight, be into fitness, etc. I just wanted to get a better understanding of what a healthy weight range was so I could show her the correct calories via a tree calculator. I understand 1000 calories too low. If she is combative I am scheduling a doctor visit right away. Edit #2 We have never criticized her weight. Both my wife and I had parents that were critical of our weight for different reasons growing up. She was 160 last year at her checkup and she was 130 this year at her checkup. The doc asked her about her weight loss and she said she was making better choices. Drinking water instead of soda. If she got a treat, instead of getting a shake she would get an ice cream cone. She wanted to go on walks and be a little more active. None of that screamed a problem. To us at the time we didn't think that was bad. We didn't know she was counting calories until recently and we didn't know she was trying to stick to a 1000 calories. We want to approach this a loving caring way. Hence why I asked about tdee and what is a healthy weight range. If 115 is okay for her gender and age that is fine but she needs to eat more and do this in a healthy manner. Final update. We have an appointment to talk to her pediatrician tomorrow(not with her) to get some advice on how to move forward and approach this. We were going to talk to her tonight but decided to wait until we talk to her doctor. Appreciate the input from you guys.

The shy cat made me kind of force the food into his mouth that had the pill. I then 1.5 hours later tried to get him into a crate and he let me grab him but then flailed and wouldn't go in crate. 2 hours later I'm covered in scratches and have to rebook flight to next day.

However, I will say that this is also in conjunction with changing my diet over the past couple of years to include a significant amount of fresh food and doing my best not to eat fast food or ultra-processed food. I'm not claiming this is a cure-all, but I feel so much better after doing this for over a month now. I have noticed a significant difference while drinking this every morning before eating or drinking anything else: -1 tsp cumin seeds -1 tsp fenugreek seeds -1 tsp ajwain seeds Boil in as much water as you want for a couple of minutes, strain the seeds, squeeze some lime in the water, and drink. You may have a hard time finding fenugreek and ajwain in the regular grocery store, but it is easily found in Indian grocery stores and some other Asian grocery stores. P.S. It doesn't taste that good, but it will grow on you over time. Just think of it as taking medicine.
