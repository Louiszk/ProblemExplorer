Generally speaking: Baseball is boring. Hear me out... It's largely why baseball struggles to grow its fanbase -- limited by regional exposure and TV syndication and struggling to attract a broader audience because there are very few personalities in baseball.  Like most baseball teams (minus the Phillies), the Dodgers suffer from this. I realize it's an insane argument to make when we win 100 games, and when guys like Mookie and Freddie are putting up insane numbers in the regular season. But is it too greedy to ask for a little swag on top of it all? For a little personality? For a post-game interview that doesn't feel like the most eye-roll PR talking-points of \"well we just made a game plan and went out there and found our pitches...\" . It's funny - I watched maybe 120 games this season, and I can barely remember any of them. I remember us generally being solid... but, any real memorable moments ? So what is \"Swag\" and how is it measured? How could one even possibly scout for this? I confess, I don't know. Guys like Machado \"felt wrong\" for our team, so maybe not all bravado is created equal. Other times, swag tends to backfire on us (Urias, Trevor B...). But despite the new rules that create much more exciting gameplay IMO, the sport still lacks the \"big balls Pete\" mentality that elevates the entire sport. While I appreciate Mookie's sportsmanship and respect he has among other ballplayers, a dash of boldness now and then wouldn't hurt. With the rare exception of teams like this year's Phillies, it feels like baseball is almost designed to be even-keeled, subdued and homogenous. Don't rock the boat, or you'll ruin the streak -- don't rock the boat, you'll get sent down....  Why is baseball designed to be boring??   Is it the amount of games that makes it impossible to sustain that kind of attitude?   Is it the superstition of acting too cocky? Fear of retribution?   Is it the 10,000 players in the farm leagues all dying to take your spot that makes you toe-the-line?   Is it the fair-weather LA fans (or perhaps more generously: the traffic-concerned LA-fan base...) ?   Is it an LA problem where we're used to and expect championships and nothing less (compared to the mostly battered sports town of Philly and their understandable hunger to win?)?   Or is it simply that losing is boring and this argument wouldn't exist if we were winning?   I could be way off base here, but would love to hear your thoughts as I'm clearly trying to understand this myself. If you agree with this, what's at the heart of it and how could it be fixed? Suffice it to say, feels like baseball -- and for sure the Dodgers - need some cajones. Or maybe just a Bryce Harper. Thanks for letting me rant.

Another thing: today, while trying to kill as many animals as possible, I found a mythic deathclaw sleeping peacefully inside the house in Robotics Pioneer Park.

Amateurs will look at his data and will conclude that he is due for regression. Do not do this. You guys know that Paredes is elite at pulling the ball in the air (very similar to Nolan Arenado). Pulled fly-balls is the best outcome for a hitter. It's what every hitter should be trying to accomplish at the plate. Parades ADP is #179. Still comically low. The market does not believe in him.

They need something that gets everyone's attention. The Oakland A's are experiencing something very similar, moving over to a minor league field in Sacramento. I propose a new event based on the Winter Classic and Stadium Series model, wherein two professional sports teams that are struggling the hardest in their sport compete against each other in a 3 game series. So let's take Arizona and Oakland. One game takes place at the Shark Tank near Oakland, with the A's playing the Coyotes in Ice Hockey. Next game is at the Diamondback's Chase Field in Phoenix, and the sport is Baseball. If it's a tie in the series, I'm not sure what the tie breaker should be, but let's say the Coyotes win the hockey game and the baseball game? The Coyotes play the Diamondbacks. Just like the Winter Classic and Stadium Series, there will be limited edition jerseys (which hopefully will be sought after, because you're buying a limited edition jersey from a team that might be folding soon), there will be other attractions and media booths because it's less of a sports game and more of an \"event,\" basically there will be opportunities to make money for the city, for sponsors, and for the team. So with all that excess money changing hands? The winner of the series gets a cash infusion into their team. Just like that? Boom, the Coyotes and A's both have cool headlines in the news with some buzz being generated, and maybe even new Hockey fans come from it.

Some background: I have played sports for the majority of my life very consistently from ages 4 to 15. I'm 23M now. I was a baseball pitcher, so definitely nowhere near being considered very athletic, but regardless never had much issue with stamina apart from jogging. I got back into tennis a few months ago and was able to play for like 30 mins at a time with no breaks. I had become rather sedentary after I quit baseball at 15, but still regularly exercised, mostly free weights and even did olympic lifting for about a year starting 2ish years ago. In the past couple weeks, I started noticing that I'd get really winded playing tennis for even like 5 mins at a time. I play pickleball as well and similar issues arose. I have been vaping for over 2 years or so now, and have been smoking weed since I was 17. I'm in the blistering heat of Florida right now, so my respiratory issues could be partially due to heat exhaustion, but I'm starting to think it's more than that. It feels like I can't catch my breath, and I get winded quicker after each break. I've also used inhalants for some time so that's an issue too, but I find that easier to stop than vaping. I guess my question is, has anyone had a similar experience that has caused concern about their smoking habits? And maybe also, should I see a doctor about this soon? It's heavily affecting my ability to play sports. My parents don't know about my smoking, so they just think I'm out of shape, which is probably also true. Kind of just trying reasons to kick this stupid habit. Tips for quitting are appreciated! TLDR; Staring noticing respiratory issues playing sports and think its because of vaping.

It's a really bad day in baseball history and it's going to make it super hard to care about baseball going forward, at least for me. So many cities are being threatened with losing their teams so their billionaire owners can extract more wealth from struggling cities' budgets and this sets a bad precedent. I love baseball. I've been a lifelong Orioles fan, my grandparents were season ticket holders for decades and started to attend games literally the moment the Orioles came to Baltimore (my grandfather also ran a farm team and coached little league for decades in my western MD hometown). While the Orioles have always been my home team, I have come to love the A's ever since moving to Oakland 10 years ago, and I root for them as my 2nd choice team. If you have never been to the Oakland Coliseum for an A's game, I'm truly sorry you missed out. I've been to 8 baseball stadiums and outside of Camden Yards. There's been no other place I'd rather watch baseball. As a stark contrast to SF Giants fans, the A's fans are some of the most passionate, die-hard fans I've ever experienced. Even as Fisher under invested in the team, sold of the best players, closed concessions, jacked up ticket prices, and started to threaten to leave as soon as he bought the team, A's fans always made that stadium feel electric whether it was sold out or just a couple of thousand fans. It feels like an extra shitty day in baseball as the MLB owners voted to waive relocation fees and allow a billionaire trust fund baby to abandon one of the most diverse cities in the country, with one of the largest and wealthiest baseball markets, and perfect weather most days of the year, to set up shop in Vegas, a small market in the middle of the desert. If the Raiders games are any indication, future A's players will be playing in a mostly empty stadium where most of the fans will be rooting for the opposing team. Who wants to watch baseball in 120 degree weather? Anyway, thanks for letting me rant. I'm sad and angry, and feeling frustrated with Manfred, MLB team owners, and it sucks watching people who don't know anything about the situation or Oakland talk shit about this beautiful city, much like how people denigrate Baltimore without knowing what they're talking about. I hope one day billionaires are taxed into oblivion. Especially trust fund billionaires who did nothing to deserve their wealth other than to luck into a family (and in John Fisher's case, a family who's wealth was largely built off of sweatshop labor).

This relocation saga has plagued me, my home, and my community for some time. I'm from the LA area, born and raised. I went red when most everyone else in the neighborhood went Dodger blue. I got to see my team win their one and only World Series title, watched it on tv with my dad. Have continued to be a fan through all of the clubs bullshit these last almost 40 years. But now I'm supposed to blindly march forward with my fandom knowing our crap owner could pull the same bullshit as John Fisher, and that MBL will without issue support it. That shit don't fly for me. I moved away from the southland to pursue college in NorCal. Been here in the east bay for some time now. My partner of 8 years is a diehard A's fan. Baseball was a cornerstone in our home; we went to every Angels/A's game when Anaheim came up to Oakland. We both hated on our respective regional rivals (her the Giants, and me the Dodgers). Being a fan of the bigger better ball clubs was easy. Being a fan of our teams was a choice and took work. That's what being an underdog is all about. We have matching OG Starter jackets, new school Starters, matching ugly christmas sweaters, custom jerseys, hell, we have a reversable team blanket on our bed (winners team gets to have their team up for the night). Baseball is a cornerstone in our relationship, specifically Oakland baseball. I've now easily seen more games at the Coliseum than back in LA during my childhood. Local east bay baseball means a great deal to us, so we were passionate about this relocation. But now, how am I (and even her more so) supposed to continue supporting MLB for ripping baseball away from our community, from us? I am appalled at the handling of the relocation in support of a broke billionaire that wants nothing more than free money. And to hear there are almost 7 other teams (including our own) waiting in the wings to pull the same stunt is inexcusable. This scam professional sport teams pull for public money in exchange for our fandom is a greedy attempt of making money at the expense of the poor. These organizations and teams are asking for our hard earned dollars upfront and then stealing our wallet to further line their own pockets. How much money do these owners really need? It's an embarassment, and they should all be ashamed for supporting the distruction of our love for the game. Thanks clown-shoes Manfred, limp-dick Fisher, and everyone other owner that voted yes for ruining something so special to so many people. With the Athletics completing their move to Vegas, baseball is officially dead in our home. The romance of the game is forever gone. Today I hang up my Angels hat.

My hand eye is excellent but my consistency is abysmal which can be so frustrating. I try to stay positive and keep at it.

I'm so impressed with his way of explaining things that I sometimes make my girlfriend watch a quick video because it's that exciting to figure out one more aspect of a proper swing. I can't recommend him enough. I just happened upon a random 30 second YouTube clip from the dark haired polo guy who looks like he definitely own a small yacht - talking about the wrist set showing how the pros almost fold their lead wrist up and over the club/trail wrist in the back swing. I couldn't do this naturally, it felt forced and terrible but once I started setting my wrists like that from the jump I was able to hold it in the backswing. This completely unlocked my natural golf swing. I can't believe it, so for anyone struggling with inconsistency, the typical wrist flip, and maybe have a swing where you unnaturally focus on your arm movement in the backswing-you've gotta try this. Yes it makes sense for the feet/hands to be the most important part of setup up for a consistent swing but this small change has been incredible for me. The most impressive thing is it makes it impossible to chicken wing the trail arm and locks it into a completely natural stopping point from which I can drive down and towards the ball- which I needed so badly, to be able to feel a natural/solid stopping point effectively stopping me from over extending and getting into a baseball ready position from which point so many things can go wrong.

Two weeks ago, a swarm settled in a tree at my apartment complex. Some residents, including myself, reached out to a local beekeeper, hoping to safely relocate these thousands of bees for FREE. However, before the beekeeper could arrive, pest control was called in, and they exterminated the entire swarm. The situation repeated itself on a larger stage just yesterday, at a baseball game in Arizona where a docile swarm of 20,000 bees delayed the game. It's all over the news right now. The crowd cheered as an exterminator, mistakenly hailed as a beekeeper, killed the bees while hyping up the audience, and being rewarded with the first pitch of the game. The dissonance between the crowd's reaction and the grim reality of what was happening was jarring. I understand the concerns about public safety, especially in crowded places like apartment complexes and baseball stadiums. The presence of a bee swarm can indeed be alarming and poses a genuine risk to people, particularly to those with allergies. It's reasonable for management and event organizers to prioritize human safety and take swift action. However, the methods employed and the urgency to resort to extermination, rather than exploring safer, more humane alternatives for relocating the bees, is a part of the conversation that seems distressingly overlooked. It's shocking how these events are spun into stories of heroism. The narrative often shared is one of rescue and relocation when the reality is extermination. Despite widespread claims and reassurances that the bees are being safely moved to new locations, the truth is far grimmer, as confirmed by firsthand accounts and clear evidence from pest control practices. This consistent misrepresentation makes it feel like I'm in the minority for caring about these bees, which is both isolating and frustrating. I'm not looking to rally people to a cause right here; I just want to express how upsetting it is to see such disregard for life and truth. It feels like these bees, crucial to our ecosystem, are just seen as nuisances or even entertainment. This is about more than just bees; it's about our relationship with nature and our willingness to overlook the destruction of vital parts of our environment. Does anyone else feel this way, or am I just shouting into the void here?

So here's what i like about sports teams: an underdog, i dont like a team that a favorites and win every game. I prefer a mid table team that fight for wins (something like Maclaren, if you know F1) maybe they have fast players, like they are known for stealing bases or trick plays, something that could make the game a bit more interesting. They take gambles to try and win kind of thing. They have \"old stars\", they have on there team players close to retirement, that used to be one of the greats but now the have been transfered and are con they way out, they dont always play but still make magic every now and then. I'm not sure my post makes sense or there are any baseball teams like that but i would love to chat about the teams and get to know them anyway :) Thank you for reading <3    "], ["Need help with a baseball technique", "7", "4", "2024-04-19T18:48:29.354000+0000", "https://www.reddit.com/r/CTsandbox/comments/1c84mc1/need_help_with_a_baseball_technique/", "I have a jjk oc that plays baseball so like I need help making a technique Grade 1 or special grade if you want :)    "], ["Need help coding 2d baseball game", "0", "0", "2024-06-02T01:38:17.649000+0000", "https://www.reddit.com/r/godot/comments/1d62b5m/need_help_coding_2d_baseball_game/", "This is my first time coding/game developing and I'm working on a 2d baseball game.

It's between the Chicago Cubs and the Boston Red Sox. I'm not geographically tied to either since I'm from Australia. For the other sports I go for the Blackhawks the Bears and the Celtics. Celtics being the highest on the hierarchy as Basketball is my favourite sport out of hockey and football although I love all sports. Reasons I like the cubs is because of their pinstripes and the mix of modern and classic in their uniforms I don't think they have a bad uni all look super clean plus I have a few friends in Chicago if I was ever going to move to the US Chicago is where I'd go. Red Sox I was born October the 27th 2004 the day they broke the curse of bambino and won the World Series. I love their hats the B looks so clean and while I much prefer the cubs jerseys I much prefer Bostons hats by a mile. Im really big into fashion so that's playing a factor two whatever team I could pull off more outfits with would be cool. I guess the biggest factor would be the passion and sizes of crowds noise I really want to follow the louder and more passionate team aswell because passionate fanbases mean everything to me. If I were Red Sox I'd have a even split of Chicago and Boston sports. If I were to choose the Cubs I'd basically be a Chicago sports fan minus the Celtics. I think that's a lot more easier to explain to people and makes more sense. In terms of what I've seen on videos the vibes at both Fenway and Wrigley are awesome. I'd be happy to become a fan of either and what ever one I choose I'll have a soft spot for the other.

They begin their encounter with the cullens smoothly, Laurent as their representative talking with Carlisle, Carlisle admits having a permanent residence nearby and Laurent gets impressed and also interested about their life style, Carlisle then suggests they come to their house later and see for themselves what they have created in Forks, but then the wind comes and reveals to James Bella is a Human, they all then have a faceoff, afterwards everybody leaves. Now here comes the interesting part, Laurent and Carlisle even after their quarrel still agree that the nomads go see the house, so   Bella, Edward, Emmet and Alice go to the Jeep take Bella away.   Jasper, Esme, Rosalie and Carlisle are to take the nomads with them to the house.   Now, its confirmed Laurent got to the house and probably had a chat with the cullens inside, afterwards he abandoned his coven and went for the Denali. BUT what about James and Victoria? why didnt they follow Carlisle? did they just ran into the forest abandoning Carlisles lead after following him for a while? that part was not clear for me in the books, because the nomads actually leave the field together and Carlisle then leads them to the house, but its never explained how the two nomadic vampires left and Laurent stayed, did they give any reasons for leaving?   Like for example, James said: Look, your house is probably pretty interesting, but im feeling hungry right now, so I hope you dont mind, nice meeting you though! sorry about provoking your boy earlier, sometimes my instinct gets the better of me.   Or Victoria : Im going with James, he will probably need my help, but nice meeting you guys, looking forward to another time!   Like, isnt that weird that they didnt explained in the book? maybe they explained in midnight sun but i didnt read that one. Also, Laurent is supposed to be submissive to James, how is that he can make his own choice to go with Carlisle? What you guys think ??
