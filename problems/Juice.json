Hydaelyn fights us to basically have us prove that humanity/the world is at point where we are strong enough to protect ourselves and take on Endsinger.

Now I wonder, why didn't the Twelve suicide for us to use the spaceship instead of using the mother crystal? It was all or nothing at that point anyways. If the WOL lost to endsinger, the twelve would have just died anyways?  Also, the Twelve mention that they've been sucking up all the prayer juice for the last 12000 years and it's shaped them and molded them into what they are. Releasing that back into the world as aether surely would cause disasters no? They say their balancing influence will still be around even after they die but how? Why? They just throw out a line like that and we just believe it? It is what it is?  If they're gone, where is all that prayer juice gonna go now? Where is Hydaelyn's prayer juices gonna go now that she's gone? She is confirmed a primal and we all know multiple of the same primal can't exist at the same time. So now that she is dead, another of her could theoretically be summoned by people just praying to her. It's confirmed that these prayers basically became aether if it wasn't already aether to begin with. Isn't that gonna effectively create primals of the twelve and hydaelyn all around Eorzea? It's not like people will just stop praying and worshipping them going forward.  Unrelated to the Twelve and Hydaelyn, the WOL and friends just peace out of the void to leave two people to figure out how to bring a world back from the brink by themselves? That's wild.

But even within this vulgar capitalist framing of human relationships, there's a flawed assumption. Trophies are timeless, they mainly have sentimental value, so they don't appreciate or depreciate. This is not the case with people or relationships. Both can and will change. Microsoft stock was once worth nothing. Nokia was once considered \"high value.\" When your kids beget grandkids, you see how the ROI multiplies. As someone's spouse, you are the most influential person in their life. If 10 years later you decide your spouse is an asshole, it's fair if others ask: what did you do to them? I say if you don't think you can be a positive influence and lead someone in the right direction, don't marry them. So yeah sure, increase your value to get a solid foundation, this isn't an endorsement of a full-on \"fixer-upper\" approach. Just recognize that you're getting a foundation, not a complete package.

I want to share a story with you how I had worst 1 hour in my entire life in Paris :) As a little experienced travel I always try to remember that not everywhere it is easy to find a public toilet that can be used.

And in last place I almost begged stuff to let me use it, but she said that she cannot let me in to use it and showed me where nearest public toilet is located. So I spent around 20 minutes to ask cafes about letting me use the toilet So in this point I didn't care if it is a public toilet, I just needed to use it as fast as possible. And I just ran to this place and surprise, there was a queue of 15 people before me. I need to tell that it was not a regular public toilet, this one was fully automated and didn't have a regular door that you can open by yourself. After every usage you needed to wait around 3 minutes just for the door to open, so for every person it is at least 5-7 minutes. So in this state I was just sitting on the floor and hoping that my body not gonna give up. And I was so disappointed that in such a big city as Paris it is so hard to fulfill a basic human need. Why am I writing this silly story? Cause I find it is very wrong that in center of such a popular tourist destination, at least around Eiffel Tower it is so hard to find a basic public toilet.

Her main problem is night time after she's fell asleep. She recently got Dexcom and it's been 10x better than before which i'm so thankful for and she seems to be happy with it. i've learned everything i know about diabetes from her and her mom, she's the first person i've lived with that had diabetes. we're both 19 if that means anything. So down to why I made the post. More often than not her number goes either super high (300+) or super low (45-) while she's asleep. When i'm home, I stay up usually all night due to my schedule for work being 7pm-5:30am and I watch her number on the app. When it gets low, I grab her some orange juice and a glucose tablet and try to wake her up. When I wake her up, she starts calling me names like \u00e2\u0080\u009cpiece of sh t\u00e2\u0080\u009d and \u00e2\u0080\u009cstupid bi ch\u00e2\u0080\u009d along with moans and just overall bad attitude because I woke her up out of her sleep.

Let every type of T17 unlock one, the new scarabs are so bad you can literally use 4 of the same and its not all that strong. Yes, they drop more often, i get it. But you need all the slots in the map device to juice one mechanic now, where it was just 1 gilded scarab before. Splitting the scarab up into more specific use cases is not a bad choice in itself, but if that means you have to use more of your limited slots to reach the same effect its a straight up nerf. If we get way more scarabs give us way more slots. Its that simple. Dont nerf endgame juicing please. The league mechanic is insanely boring and frustrating at the same time.

I tried shooting at 60 fps and then conforming to 23.98 in Adobe Premiere and it still looks jittery. So my only fix has been to shoot at 48 fps and then conform to 23.98 in Adobe Premiere. And even then the jittery is still vaguely there. I've tried \"slow follow\", \"fast follow\", a myriad of shutter speeds. I can't seem to figure out how to get the jittery to go away on 24 fps pan moves.

Turned a pen blank, the wood seemed weaker than before, and when I tried assembling the pen the wood actually started peeling apart, definitely not something that had happened without resin. Realized I needed to get more scientific about it, read some more, watched some videos. Moisture might be an issue--wood was about 14%. Threw a couple more blanks in the toaster oven, this time with a separate oven thermometer. Set it at 225, thermometer read 240. Baked until I wasn't loosing any more weight on the scale and my moisture meter was lower than its limit of 5%. Ran vacuum until no more bubbles, then about 6 more hours. Soaked for 36 hr in the cactus juice, three times as long as under vacuum (work stuff came up, had planned 24h). Baked 2.5 hr at 220 according to the thermometer in the oven (set at 200). Weight was double the dry weight prior to going under vacuum. Tried turning both blanks today, about 5 days later. First was a pen, and once more having some bits flaking or peeling off as I get to my desired size. Didn't bother finished/sanding to see if it peeled further, didn't want to waste the rest of the kit. Then tried a bottle opener kit. Hollow it out for the hardware to go in, turn it to size, walls are 4-5 mm thick. Drop it while repositioning it, it drops 3 feet onto concrete and splits completely along the drilled hole. Never had these issues with this same wood without resin. The cactus juice seems to have made it more brittle a weaker, rather than the opposite as intended.

Examples:  Capital Ships   FC-H9 Rhinoceros   FC-FQ Ventifact   FC-4V Combine   Frigates   FC-U8 Ashta   FC-2E Fjord   FC-BZ Baler   Fighters   FC-53 Peregrine   FC-7D Arete   FC-AA Trowel     Ecliptic  Ecliptic tend to have ships named after melee weapons I've noticed, and that matches their \"shoot first collect credits later\" mentality and coinsides with their brutality, so I like to continue that theme. They all prefix with \"Ecliptic\", but I don't like that so it's up to you!  Examples:  Capital Ships   Warhammer   Greataxe   Frigates   Scimitar   Falchion   Fighters   Kerambit   Billy Club   Crimson Fleet The Crimson Fleet ships you see in game are named after ethereal undead it seems, which aligns with the fearmongering they go for so I stick with that too. I like to extend it beyond that to other undead and fear inducing mythological creatures. Similar to Ecliptic they've prefixed \"Crimson Fleet\" but I dislike that so I like to omit it.  Examples:  Capital Ships   Lich King   Poltergeist   Cerberus   Frigates   Ghast   Chimera   Draugr   Fighters   Wisp   Chupacabra   Ghoul     Va'Ruun Ships  The Va'ruun seem to name their ships after religious doctorine, rituals, terminology etc. Words that mean sadness, or hostility I find fits in with their theme as well. Someone else suggested using the scientific names of snakes and other reptiles which I think aligns as well! All these things are easily googlable. Again they're generally prefixed Va'ruun,  I think it's more acceptable here for some reason, so I will be including it, but again, omit where you feel it unnecessary.  Examples:  Capital Ships   Va'Ruun Exorcism   Va'Ruun Covenant   Va'Ruun Anomochilus   Frigates   Va'Ruun Krait   Va'Ruun Lement   Va'Ruun Emnity   Fighters   Va'Ruun Rite   Va'Ruun Boiga   Va'Ruun Sin     Independent ships  For a more independent ship names, I like to consider something a character might find sentimental, or a place that might be important to them, and then name the ship after that. If you consider someone who's SO passed away they might name their ship after them, or a possession that means a lot to them, where they used to hang out as a child, or a concept that has a lot of emotional weight for them. Examples:   The Well's Revenge   The Northern Lights   Juliette's Locket   Decaprio III   Father's Rifle   It can additionally be helpful to consider a key feature of the ship, and focus on that.   Do you have two long arms either side with a gap in the middle? Consider something with the number 2, Duel, Bi-, Twin, etc.   Is it sleek looking? Gonsider naming it after a model of car that similarly sleek.   Does it have a purpose as a ship? Like hauling specific cargo, or building space stations? Name it something obvious like \"[material] Hauler\" or \"Construction Drone\".   I hope this at least helps people getting some bein juices flowing, and hopefully cuts down on the name suggestion posts. For those that are good at naming ships, drop your conventions below! Let's make this as supportive as possible!

MF GEAR:   Item Quant (55) and Rarity (143) in Gear (i am using bisco, so if i have rampage it goes more)   My juicing strategy: SCRABS:   Polished Divination   Polished Reliquery   Guilded Harbinger   Guilded Abyss   SEXTANTS:   Magic pack size   Hunted traitors   Divination or gloom shrine   Abyss   MAP: (Min 150 to 200 quant corrupted, but not always 8 mods, it is hard for me to bring all the maps to 8 mods)   Cemetery or Burial Chambers   MY ATLAS TREE:   Wandering Path with the abyss, beyond, deli with the blue altar (30% quant and rarity)   WISPS: I get a minimum of 2 colors to 2k, sometimes all 3 colors to 2k. I am not getting the blue ones always so its either blue and purple or purple and yellow. Question:   Do i have to use guilded scrabs always or polished is ok?   Quantity - i usually run maps with 90 to 100 or 120 max, is this enough or do i have to run always more than 100 quant with 8 mods   How to get more loot, what am i doing wrong?   Do i have to increase my quant and rarity in gear?   Do i have to increase my map mods or sextants?   My friend is running Aurabot, does he have to add anything to his gear?      "]]
