Ideally, whenever requested (like registering a new master_password), I would create a new database which would be accessible only through the master_key hash. I thought about creating an user whose password would be such hash, and in future instances I would connect through that user; but wouldn't that mean that the \"super\" user postgres would be able to access it either way because he is, well, super?

I'm wondering if anyone has any ideas, as I'm stuck handwaving this subject with \"It's just the Internet but faster for reasons\". Not that there's anything wrong with keeping things simple, but if there are concepts or further reading I would love some assistance. I have almost zero intention of going in-depth about this in the prose of my narrative, as there's no point and the reader has no reason to care. But as the author, knowing how my own setting works is key to keeping my narrative consistent and therefore immersive, particularly when I decide I want to try to get a little hard with the science fiction. So with that in mind, how exactly would I go about creating a hypothetical \"Web 3.0\"? What kinds of concepts or theories could I use or expand on? From a Doylist perspective, the reason why I as an author \"want\" a Web 3.0 in my setting is because of cyberspace and sapient AI. Specifically, the concept of full-sensory immersion virtual realities that allow for near-zero latency communications (limited by the speed of light), co-existing alongside huge sapient data constructs, both of which would require a huge amount of processing power and, more importantly, an extremely fast data infrastructure capable of communicating a huge volume of data between two or more systems. As I declared in the title, I'm not interested in breaking causality, as the scale of this network would only operate between continents on Earth or at most between planets in our local solar system (so lag times of ~5 hours from Earth to Pluto, at the speed of light). From a Watsonian perspective, a megacorporate government wants a monopoly on the Internet because haha dystopia. The only way to make the world transition from Web 2.0 to Web 3.0 is either by collapsing Web 2.0 (but then people are far more likely to rebuild what they're familiar with with only slight improvements, rather than switch to something new) and/or for Web 3.0 to have an overwhelming advantage (reliable security, low latency, high data capacity). So they would...develop that thing. And as an author who despises misusing the word \"quantum\", I did extensive reading on qubit computing, cryptography, entanglement, and quantum teleportation and came to the conclusion that quantum computing (and by extension quantum networking) is basically just a gimmick that has few practical applications beyond designing batteries or running lots of mathematical simulations in very specific contexts. Compared to classical computing, particularly for end-user consumers, it'd be like using a Dyson sphere to boil water so you can power a steam engine. Please correct me (rudely if you must) if I'm wrong on this notion. A quantum internet with 100% accurate teleportation of qubits doesn't allow for any data transfer faster than classical bit-based communication because even though you can store a theoretically infinite amount of information on a qubit due to superposition, you can only extract 1-bit worth of data because the system collapses when measured. Ergo, 1-bit in, 1-bit out. Right now, the only possible explanation I have is a consumer-friendly implementation quantum cryptography--in a setting where cyberattacks are perpetrated by sapient AI, encryption and security to keep systems functioning means using a network protocol wherein data transmission is extraordinarily difficult to intercept. And even in our current technology, we have AES-256 which is already quantum resistant without utilizing any quantum computing on its own like entanglement, but at least then I can just scale up the level of the threat since we still don't know the theoretical limit of quantum computation. Also, my setting has room-temperature superconductors. It's an alien material. Maybe that's relevant? So what kind of things should I try handwaving to make something like this work? Should I just bite the bullet and introduced FTL communications? Am I overthinking things and our current Internet is only limited by physical fiber-optic infrastructure? Should I just stick with \"it's the Internet but better, don't ask questions\" if the reader gets curious about the mechanisms?    "]]
