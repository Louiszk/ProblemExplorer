                  the first post is: "So I've been using pre-ground lavazza qualita rossa and my coffee always turns out to be sour and ashy.
                    I'm using moka pot on gas stove low heat, water just under the valve, no tamping the grounds. I tried using hot, room temp water,
                      leveling grounds with finger, changing heat but nothing really works. Only difference is how good the extraction looks.
                        Am I doing something wrong? I would be thankful for any advice."'''

    post = "Too much coffee. Any advice? I own a DeLonghi La Specialista which has been my trusty sidekick for a good while. A few days ago, I ran into a puzzling issue. Initially, the machine faced problems with grinding the coffee beans. When attempting to grind, it sounded like the beans were getting stuck, and it just wouldn't grind. After multiple attempts of removing all beans and giving it a thorough cleaning, voil√É ! It started grinding correctly again. However, that's not where the story ends. As I had a small amount of coffee in the basket, I decided to run the reset program just in case. I pressed the x2 and 'my' buttons simultaneously. Since then, every time I try to grind coffee (on the x1 setting), the machine grinds an excessive amount. I'm talking almost double what it should. The basket completely overflows before the machine stops. Obviously, this isn't normal, and I'm at a loss on how to fix it. Has anyone experienced something similar or has any advice on what I could do to resolve this? Thanks in advance! "
